1,10sa5uj,yongjoop,406.0,0.96,70,UIUC,"I am Yongjoo Park ([https://yongjoopark.com/](https://yongjoopark.com/)), an assistant professor in the computer science department, and this post shares a critical bug currently present in our university email system.

(I have updated my website to show that the website owner indeed wrote this post)

(There seems to be a workaround if you have access to U Gmail; check the end of this post)

**# What is the critical bug?**

Some emails, sent to [netid@illinois.edu](mailto:netid@illinois.edu), are silently discarded. Specifically, I have performed tests using several different university emails, and the issue was reproduced 100% time. This is how you can test if the same issue might be happening to you as well.

1. Download this pdf file (Gmail conversation): ([https://drive.google.com/file/d/17cW2xlRSX0qD1qOAQOQu8W0Ydqejh1dh/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17cW2xlRSX0qD1qOAQOQu8W0Ydqejh1dh/view?usp=sharing)).
2. Send an email, from your personal external account (e.g., Gmail), to your university email, [netid@illinois.edu](mailto:netid@illinois.edu), including the pdf as an attachment.

Then, the email never arrives in your mailbox, not in your junk folder, not in your weekly spam digest. The email simply never appears.

**!!** ([u/pkgamma](https://www.reddit.com/u/pkgamma/) noted that emails go through when they are sent directly to ""@g.illinois.edu"")

This failed delivery not only occurs when an email includes such an attachment **but also when an email contains certain contents of the attachment, and moreover, the university email system never tells you the fact that it discarded them**. I do not know the exact condition triggering this behavior. Note that the attachment I'm using for the test is a regular research discussion with external collaborators, which is far from malware. It is possible that this issue occurred only for the people I have performed tests with, or maybe it will be fixed in a few days or in a few weeks after a regular software update. **If you observe the same issue, please share it as comments so we can have more data points.** If you experience the issue, please share this post with your friends so they can take appropriate action.

&#x200B;

**# Will the university fix this?**

I am communicating with the university IT and the faculty in the department to escalate the concern; however, it may take some time. Meanwhile, I wanted to share this information with the other members of the university as promptly as possible because, again, this is something that can (or may already have) impact your life.

&#x200B;

\# Update 1: The above text is modified slightly to avoid misunderstanding. Also, I am not advocating removing the spam filter itself. It is doing a great job in most cases; however, when it indeed discards our emails, the system must share its actions with us.

\# Update 2: u/Titan8883 and u/pkgamma noted that emails go through when they are sent directly to ""@g.illinois.edu"".

\# Update 3: This post has been shared on Feb 3 with the Head of the department, and an Associate Head of the department, who then shared it with the leadership in the college and the university.

5,ebgxnl,wamblycambam,557.0,0.98,85,UIUC,"I work at a store at Marketplace mall (like I’m sure many of you do). Due to the weather last night, many stores were closing early, including mine. I left for my bus stop around 8:00— like many freshman here, I don’t have a car. The bus is my only method of transportation. Again, due to the weather, some buses were not running or were 45 minutes to an hour off schedule. 

I was stranded. There were no cars in the parking lot that were anywhere close to me. There was no bus coming. Anyone I could call to pick me up was at best 20 minutes away. I called my boyfriend (we are long distance) just because I wanted his opinion on what to do. Wait who knows how long for the bus? Call a friend and risk them getting in an accident in the conditions? Walk? 

It was around this time that a man in a dinky, old, white SUV pulled up next to me and my bus stop on the edge of the parking lot. He came out of no where, or maybe I wasn’t paying close enough attention. Either way, he was there, and nobody else was. #Exposed am I right? I was talking to my boyfriend through my headphones, so I guess the man didn’t realize I was on the phone at all. 

He asked me if I needed a ride. I told him no. He asked again. I told him no. 
He scooted towards the passenger door. Told me that I could trust him. Told me it was cold, and I was too pretty to be in the cold.
I told him no, I told him goodbye. He persisted.
This man was close enough to me that my boyfriend heard every end of the situation. He heard how the man persisted, calling me gorgeous— “you are so blessed to be that gorgeous. You really are something, sweetheart.” He was still getting closer to the door, and I still had no where to go. He asked my name. I told him a fake one. He continued to persist, ignoring my rejections. 
“I would love to have someone as gorgeous as you in my car. You really are something.” 
He was too close to the passenger door now; I didn’t know what to do. I could’ve tried to run, however there was snow and ice on the ground and I wasn’t in snow shoes. He was bigger and probably stronger than me. Probably faster too. I’m glad I didn’t find out. 

It was at this time, a couple of women from across the parking lot began to approach me. When they were about halfway across the lot, I heard them yell “Ma’am? Are you okay?” I looked at them and shook my head no as the man continued to try to coerce me into his car. When they got a little closer, I told the man “my friends are here for me now.” He SPED away. 

The two women were very kind, and offered me help and a ride home, telling me how they knew something wasn’t right, and how they witnessed a lot of the situation from across the lot. I did not take their offer on a ride home. Most sex trafficking services work like that; just when you think someone is there to help you, they really are in on the scheme. Even though they seemed nice and genuine, you can’t be too careful. 

Eventually, a coworker who had been waiting for her ride on the other side of the mall spotted me and took me home. Had the two women and my coworker had not have been there, I don’t know how my situation would have ended. 

I’m sorry this is long, but stuff like this is so important. We HAVE to be smart guys. If you see something that you think looks wrong DO something. You could save someone like me from an unnecessary and dynamically dangerous situation.

My name is Emma, and I'm an arts major in industrial design here. Snirby has hit the front pages of r/UIUC, r/Kirby, and r/gaming, so I thought I could explain the backstory to this guy.

I am actually from California (that one comment about blood, sweat, and tears is right), and this was the first snowfall I experienced. I was really excited about it, so my roommate and I went to the quad and decided to build something. We decided on Kirby because he's cute and we wanted to promote our Kirby fangame that's in the works right now. Learning to build with snow was actually pretty easy, because I love to make sand sculptures at home and snow is kind of similar.

This winter, I'm hoping to create more sculptures in my free time, maybe even more complex since there will be more snow. I'll probably make other characters from the Kirby series because 1. the character designs are simple and 2. Kirby street is a thing here. I'm a huge Kirby fan, as well as Nintendo in general, so expect to see more of those too.

My back and legs are so sore from pushing that snowball around but it was worth it.

\-Rosati's Pizza (Closed around early November, reasons unspecified [https://imgur.com/a/PYplV1H](https://imgur.com/a/PYplV1H))

\-Merry Ann's (Closed around late 2020 [https://imgur.com/a/Z5YXjuk](https://imgur.com/a/Z5YXjuk))

\-Te Shurt ([https://imgur.com/a/DvaK8OQ](https://imgur.com/a/DvaK8OQ). Another comment links to a note suggesting it was COVID + retirement that led to this)

\-PvP Bakery and Pho Cafe between Brother's Bar and what is now Target on Green (unsure if closing related to COVID, but both have been replaced since [https://imgur.com/a/sam7FVl](https://imgur.com/a/sam7FVl))

2. Get up if you’re in the front (accessibility) seats when someone in a wheelchair gets on the bus 

3. Don’t take up more than one seat by putting your bag or legs on the seat next to you. More seats=less people standing

[More consistent reductions will be applied until further notice as of Monday, October 4.](https://preview.redd.it/wim7k4vb2vq71.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=27d43eed09d5538d91fcad30810fa2e02a334f24)

**You deserve an apology. We know we have not been meeting your expectations in recent weeks as we’ve made daily cuts to service. Staff shortages are a challenge for many industries right now, and public transit has been hit particularly hard. From childcare concerns to retirements, our Operator pool has been dwindling and we need more people to keep our service running at planned frequencies.**

**Due to daily fluctuations in staffing, we’ve been forced to make service reductions on a day-to-day basis. Daily reroute alerts have gone out through MTD’s website, personalized alert system, and social media channels. We understand that this does not always allow our passengers enough time to make alternative arrangements.**

**The shortage has put undue strain on our frontline, with many hardworking Operators logging overtime to help us fill the gaps; some of our qualified administrative staff have also been driving buses to reduce the service impact of the shortage. Through all of that, MTD is still unable to provide all of our scheduled service.**

**As a result, beginning** **Monday, October 4, these reductions are being put in place until further notice.** **This will help us to provide the most reliable and predictable service possible as we focus on restoring our workforce. This was a difficult but necessary decision, and we hope to return to our regular service soon.**

### What does all of this mean for you, our passengers?

**This means that our online Trip Planner tool, route schedules published on our website, and trip information displayed in third-party apps will be stabilized and updated to more accurately reflect the service being provided on the street. This means you can rely on these tools, along with our electronic kiosks and real-time departure information, to plan your lives around.**

**More specifically, this means that trips on the 1 Yellow and 1 Yellow Hopper, 2 Red, 5 Green and 5 Green Hopper, 10 Gold and 10 Gold Hopper, 12 Teal, 13/130 Silver, 16 Pink, 22/220 Illini, 24 Link, and 180 Lime Evening routes will be less frequent, but more consistently scheduled each day.**

##### This means passengers should check our [updated online route schedules](https://mtd.org/maps-and-schedules/routes/) for scheduled trip times, and use our updated online [Trip Planner ](https://mtd.org/maps-and-schedules/plan-trip/)to re-plan trips you take most often, to learn how these reductions will impact your travel.

* The 1 Yellow Weekday will operate at approximately 30-minute frequencies due to a reduction in 1 Yellow Hopper trips.
* The 2C Red leaving Lincoln Square at 7:40AM, and the 2U Red leaving Market Place Mall at 6:43AM and 8:57AM will not be in operation.
* The 5 Green Weekday will operate at approximately 30-minute frequencies due to a reduction in 5 Green Hopper trips.
* The 10 Gold and 10 Gold Hopper will operate at approximately 30-minute frequencies, with 60-minute frequencies on a few select trips. **Passengers should check our updated online route schedules for trip times.**
* The 12 Teal Weekday will operate at generally 20-minute frequencies, though more frequent and less frequent trips will operate at select times throughout the day.

1.
> YOu fUCKInG nerDs StAY INdOoR all daY, STop EXpECTiNG peOpLe to do THe saME 

Just some preface, I went to bars and partied frequently before all this. So please refrain yourself from assuming one's life is different just because one has a different opinion. We get it you're cool, you're fearless, you're a bar goer. Maybe put that on your resume.

2.
> If you are afraid of getting infected, don't come to campus. No one is forcing you to!

While some of us may have the luxury of doing so, many others don't. I've talked to international students who fear they might not be allowed back, so they choose to stay on campus. 

Some have unstable home life, and campus is the only way for them to learn peacefully. Some have scholarships that require them to fulfill certain activities on campus.

3.
> Then don't go to bars! 

But the virus doesn't just stop spreading when you walk out of the bar. You guys go grocery shopping, picking up restaurant foods, run errands. 

If you have read the news, you can see how bars situation and the 'fun' activities lead to outbreak.

Think of the community around the university area, we have elderly people.

4.
> But the purpose of social distancing and all that is to flatten the curve, now the hospital is free af, they can use some patients

When the campus gets thousands of people back, it's gonna spread. Florida is a good example.

5.
> Ok but I actually practice social distancing and wearing masks going to the bars.

But you can clearly see others aren't, it's hotbed for the virus. The more drunk you get, the lesser you care. This is just a personal opinion. If you're practicing social distancing and wearing masks, what's the point of going to bar? And these businesses only care about the money, they aren't here for your health. If they are, you would see enforced rules already without the city council chiming in.

6.
> But I made a poll and most of people are coming back so you guys are just circlejerking. If I don't know better, I'd assume you all are not coming back.

Ok you simply get the wrong idea. No one is saying we are not coming back. We are expressing our concerns of coming back. We have to come back for different reasons as discussed. For instance, some of us signed the lease, scholarship requirement, unstable home situation. 

And some of the incoming freshmen pipe the fuck down, joining the the usual suspects of the pro-bar people and the rest doesn't make you a cool 'freshman'. These people try so hard just to say I go to bars, ""I am already cooler than the rest of these clowns"". That's just pathetic really, if you have to try this hard.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

All that is to say, stop making everything political. Slowing down the spread of the virus doesn't make you 'weak' and 'submissive' to the government/liberal/republican. Not everything is about the left and the right. If anything, it is a selfless act. Too much of that is never a bad thing. 

Not everything is about you.

I understand the University has been put in an awful situation by the pandemic, and there are zero good choices when it comes to trying to protect the student body while also creating a relatively “normal” campus life, but I refuse to believe that slashing Spring Break entirely was the only feasible option. Maybe I’m taking the transition to online harder than most, but I can’t honestly say I feel any relief knowing that my next chance to relax outside of weekends is still more than two weeks away, and even then, it’ll just be spent on sleeping in, catching up on long-term projects, and if I’m lucky, a few hours at the ARC to lift weights, as opposed to anything remotely recreational or refreshing.

I’m hesitant to call it cruel, given the lack of malicious intent on the University’s part, but this move was so poorly planned and executed that I’m hard-pressed to think of another way to describe it. This pathetic attempt at doing the bare minimum to preserve student’s wellbeing is such a slap in the fucking face to those of us struggling to just barely stay afloat right now, I’m genuinely shocked that this idea was able to make it out of the brainstorming phase and put into effect by the administration. Not only is it completely disconnected from the actual needs and wants of the student body, it doesn’t make any logical sense: the university administration, staffed by some of the best and brightest academic administrators our country has to offer, felt that THREE WEDNESDAYS were an equivalent alternative to an entire week (SEVEN DAYS) of uninterrupted rest.

Could the university not have mandated an increase in testing frequency for traveling students? Was encouraging students to receive tests at home before returning not feasible? Was there no other option aside from taking away seven days, and giving us three in return?

32,ggh6ax,proflem,649.0,0.96,107,UIUC,"I taught four sections this semester. Two really large ones (Personal Finance - ACE240 with 350 and a 2nd 8 week course of 250 respectively) and two upper level classes that were meeting in person. And now that it's over - I think I was wrong. 

In March I was an advocate that classes should go on - continue. March forward. Lets move online and as my larger ones were online to begin with. In fact I railed on the faculty senate when they introduced a proposal to shut it all down. But now that it's wrapped up - here's what happened. 

First - privilege is real and rippled almost immediately into performance and assessment. Some students had access to their parents home offices, others shared space with siblings. Some went home to loving warm places and other very toxic and dangerous ones. And it rippled through - emails that were really heartbreaking. One day in April four emails all students struggling. 

 So to try and make it ""fair"" I moved due dates from every Sunday night to the end of the semester. Which ended with so many students saying fuck it and giving up. In a class of 250; 90 students didn't bother with the last few projects. That ratio is awful. 

Second - initially a bump in numbers attending. Where I'd usually have 20% show up for class (the rest listening to the archive or just not) the end of March we were at 30% for awhile. But the bump was short lived. And by the end of April I had a class with 11 show up. 11 out of 250.  So I wonder. Is this semester just an exercise in privilege?  And how on earth am I supposed to discern who is actually having a hard time and who is full of shit? 

Lastly - C/NC. The risk of trying to game a grade and hit a C-, is the risk of getting it wrong and landing at a high D. I use a 200 points grading system. 200-180 A; 179-160 B; 159-140 C... etc. And so many kids wound up with less than 140. Meaning if they went C/NC it'll be NC. Which puts me in a tough spot because do you let people turn things in late? And once you do what about students who got it all done? 

Concluding. These are trade-offs without right answers. Faculty aren't capable of assessing the level of personal tragedy. And it's unjust to grade on privilege. Maybe we should have just all gone home and tackled this more thoughtfully in the summer or fall.","[{'author': 'None', 'body': '> So to try and make it ""fair"" I moved due dates from every Sunday night to the end of the semester.\n\nFucking props to you for doing something like this.

At the risk of professional trouble, I disagree that a course designed to be held in-person can be converted into an online version *of equal quality* in a matter of a few days. Online education is an entirely different ball game and it's not for everybody (students or professors). Although I know many universities will be arguing the exact opposite in court because of the mounting class action.\n\nMy reaction to this whole affair is that online education is qualitatively different from in-person, *even if both are designed properly*. I completely disagree with the conclusion that I am seeing and hearing that more classes will be moved online in the future when this blows over. I think this experience is a ringing endorsement of traditional classroom instruction.\n\nAbout the grading policy - the university I currently work at did it a little differently. They allowed students to switch from letter grade to C/NC *after* they saw their letter grade. At first glance, it seems like a loophole that allows students to game the system. And it is - the philosophy is that the semester screwed everyone over so badly, that it actually becomes fair to allow students to game it.

The student had taken a job in construction to help out - and they lived in a Chicago suburb.

34,ilbp05,paper-spoons,489.0,0.93,76,UIUC,"On Friday, August 28th, my brother received the results back for his latest COVID-19 case: he tested positive. It was late at night when he received the news and, naturally, he began to freak out. He and I are both on campus this semester, and we had lunch the day before on the quad with our masks off. We had both tested negative previously, so we were unconcerned about one of us having it. We have also been incredibly careful and rarely socializing with others, so we thought a positive test was unlikely.

For the entire weekend, my brother was trapped in his dorm. No one from the school contacted or called him. Every hotline he called said they were closed, were too busy to take his call, or couldn't answer his questions. As he does not have a roommate, he was alone with no way to get food. My roommate and I also quarantined, though both of our recents tests have come back negative. None of us had any idea what to do or where to go.

At around 7:30 Monday night, my brother finally got a call from CUPHD telling him he had to leave his dorm in 15 minutes and get to a building on the other side of campus to quarantine. When he asked how he was supposed to get there, they told him to call an Uber. He, not wanting to potentially infect someone, packed up his backpack and trekked across campus in the dark. They explained to him that, in their system, they did not have a positive test for him, even though he got the message in Safer Illinois and McKinley that he tested positive. They used that as an excuse as to why they did not contact him sooner.

On Tuesday night, CUPHD called me and said that due to contact tracing I need to quarantine as well. When I asked how I would get food, they said that I should contact my RA. So I did. My RA said that I will have to move dorms to go to an isolation dorm, but my roommate was allowed to stay in our dorm. What? If I do end up having COVID, that means it's highly likely that my roommate has it too. Shouldn't she have to isolate with me as well?

It is now about noon on Wednesday. No one has contacted me or instructed me to move. I don't know when I will have to leave or where I will go. I have all my bags packed and I am now just sitting in my dorm, insanely anxious, constantly waiting for the phone call that would finally answer my questions. Since my roommate has not been ordered to quarantine, she has been buying food for me at the cafeteria, though we both have been staying inside as much as possible since we found out about my potential exposure on Friday.

I don't know what to do. I don't know where to go. My RA has told me everything she knows, which isn't much. I just want some fucking instructions. I don't even know if I'm allowed to go out to get retested. I'm scared, not just for me but for my brother and roommate as well. UIUC has royally fucked up in this case, and could have handled the situation a lot better. I understand that this time is stressful and chaotic for everyone, and that no one really knows how to handle the pandemic. I just think they could have done better.

EDIT: Clarity/more info.

UPDATE: My brother told me that the one other person he had prolonged contact with around the time of his diagnosis has already been placed in an isolation dorm. I still have not been given instructions on what to do. I have called just about all the numbers I could find, and they all either told me to call a different number, said they couldn’t help me, or were unavailable and I had to leave a message.

It was really cool that you were chilling on the porch yelling at random people that walked by. It was especially cool that you yelled ""run faster slow ass"" at me, then denied it when I called you on it because you have no spine when you're being a dick. You guys were unironically the exact kind of people that bully people at the gym, that everyone hates. I am not making a distinction of anyone who was on the porch, because none of you called the guy who did it on it, so you're enablers, and just as bad, because you allow that culture to flourish. 

When people are in public working out and getting in shape, that takes courage, because there is the fear that jerks like you are going to be dicks to them. I'm happy it happened to me instead of someone else, because it isn't going to make me give up, and didn't really hurt me, it just made me angry, but you bullying someone could cause them to give up and could really hurt them, and it isn't cool. I'll add to that, if you do this, you're not cool, no matter what you think you are, you're just an asshole and insecure with yourself enough to bully random strangers for no reason. I genuinely hope you find peace/genuine confidence, and realize that what you're doing is mean and grow as a person, because that behavior is going to make people hate you, and you will just be surrounded by other dickheads who no one likes.

To all the people who go out there, work out in public, and are trying to get healthier, please know if anyone does this to you, they're shit, and you just keep on rocking it because you're going to be much happier in life then they will.

39,rwspkv,melsuesingle,581.0,0.92,108,UIUC,"I don’t think people realize just how bad covid is in Champaign Urbana right now. Like it is worse now than it has been at any point in the pandemic, at least from a healthcare perspective.


For anecdotal evidence:
I have a couple friends who work on ambulances in CU, and a LOT of their calls are for covid - more now than ever before, according to them. 

One of my family members works in convenient cares in CU (a few different ones), and during their last shift yesterday, they texted me “We are getting slammed.  Everyone is coming back positive for Covid.” And then they texted me again at 11 pm (15 hours into their 12 hour shift) “just heading home now.”

I work in an emergency department in Urbana. We are absolutely slammed. We are inventing new hallway bed spots to fit all the patients (bc covid+ and ICU holds are taking up the actual rooms). We often have multiple ICU holds in the ED. (For some perspective on what that means, the Intensive Care Unit, or the ICU, is very full, due largely to covid. So when someone comes into the ED for an emergency and needs to be admitted to the ICU for any reason, they can’t get a spot and are held in the ED. An ICU patient generally needs a one-on-one nurse, while most ED patients are treated by a nurse also treating 2-3 other people. So every ICU hold prevents us from being able to treat 2-3 people. If we have 3 ICU holds, we can treat not just 3 fewer people, but NINE fewer people). We are putting chest tubes in people in their 20s and intubating people left and right.


For non-anecdotal evidence:
During the last week of 2021, there were 3,388 active covid cases in Champaign county (that we know of). That is 1,268 more than the week before. (The report for this week has not come out). 

To make matters worse, in the hospital system I work in, there have been 212 new covid+ employees in the past week. So we are understaffed as well. 

Note -
Hospitalizations are largely the unvaccinated people. As of Dec 27, 80% of the 142 covid+ hospitalized patients are unvaccinated, and 86% of the 30 ICU patients are unvaccinated. (These are just the numbers for the hospital system I work in, definitely not all covid+ hospitalizations in Champaign county).
However, that’s still 27 vaccinated hospitalizations and 4 vaccinated ICU patients. That’s not nothing.


I’m not saying all this to scare people. I just think we’ve become so numb seeing all the deaths and craziness, especially in big cities like New York. But we had honestly not reached that level in Champaign County, and this is the closest we have gotten to that so far during this pandemic. We’re lucky this happened after the vaccine was widely available. I cannot imagine what it would have been like before. But just please think about this when thinking about what choices to make when coming back to campus, and when being angry about the week of online schooling/testing. We are going to need to work together and be cautious when coming back to campus if we want to have a remotely (no pun intended) normal semester.

It's Jim from the Bookstore.

I'm usually on here to let you know about events here at the store. But I've read a lot of posts about how overwhelmed some of you are feeling.

Please please please listen to everyone on here letting you know that it gets better. That's incredibly hard to hear when everyone else has it all figured out.

Little secret from someone 30 years ahead of you - nobody does. Everyone has their struggles. The struggle is what makes life worthwhile.

Being brave isn't the absence of fear, it's facing fear and going forward. I am an extremely solitary person in an extremely social job. I show up everyday and have to talk to people - customers, co-workers, visitors) and I get a pit in my stomach every single time. And you know what - it's never as bad as I think it will be.

Sometimes I get tongue tied or forget to add some important information and I just have to go back in and try again. And it feels much better to succeed after failing than walking around all day thinking about the failure and what I should have done.

Everyone one of you can do this if you want to. The University has a lot of smart people deciding who they are going to admit and they picked you. If you start taking classes in a degree that you've been thinking about since you were 6 and it's awful, it's okay to change.

The scariest and most thrilling thing is realizing that this is your life, your decisions your impact on the world and we're only two days in. Use your voice - let someone know that you really liked their answer in class, challenge the professor if you think they're wrong, tell the Bookstore staff we can do better.

We all need to rely on each other. We'll get through this.

53,pln3lj,imlosingeverything,423.0,0.97,37,UIUC,"I am a senior bachelor’s degree-seeking student typing this at 5:47 AM in my cramped studio apartment since I am currently experiencing insomnia for the second time, with possible preliminary symptoms of a severe anxiety disorder of some sort. My heart is panging uncontrollably and I have cried five times in a row so far. I am not sure why I am typing this right now.

My father is a schizophrenic. My older brother committed suicide my junior year of high school after being diagnosed with schizophreniform disorder. My older sister told me three days ago that she thought about committing suicide for the first time. If I lose her too, the last piece of my heart will be ripped out, I don’t know what kind of person I might change into, and I think I will slowly lose my remaining will to live. If anyone is reading this, I hope that this introduction will enable you to read through my life’s events, because I think I am the only one who has the mental and emotional capacity in my estranged family left, potentially, to do things of this sort.

My father and mother were uneducated immigrants from China, with the usual backstory of coming to America to “seek a better living” and refuge during the unstable period of Mao Zedong’s election. Shortly after settling, they had two children two years apart around 1990-1992, my older brother and older sister. The problem was that the child abuse forced my two siblings to become parentified as early as around the 3rd to 5th grade of elementary school. My older brother bore the burden of stabilizing the family during this extremely vulnerable age, such as learning to pay overdue house bills, mediating my parent’s verbal arguments, witnessing my father punching my mother in the face, being forced to explain issues to police officers due to my parents’ language barriers, and further things that children of that age should never bear witness nor be forced to do. I was born on September 27, 1999. 

This continued to worsen, and worsen, until my father’s schizophrenia manifested to its full extent for the first time when I was in preschool. All I vaguely remember was my father, during a manic episode, destroying the entire house (breaking apart every piece of furniture, ripping the doors apart, etc.), my grandmother crying in fear (she was living within our basement at the time), and a blur in which my older brother carried me in his arms outside to protect me, my mother, and my older sister. Due to the instability of my memories at the time, as I was far too young, my older sister has always told me time and again how my older brother confronted my father to protect us, only for my father to say “you are not my son” to him. This was the tipping point. 

My father was hospitalized time and time again whenever his prodromal period would end, all throughout this elementary-school phase for my siblings and myself. My mother was always the sole breadwinner, and she would work multiple part time jobs on and off, such as in candy-manufacturing factories, or as an assembly worker for a traffic-light production company (a job she has held for about two decades, and currently has now). She is a hard worker. Unfortunately, sometimes, that is not enough. I love her, and care for her. Hell, I even loved and cared for my father to an extent. But, there are times where I inevitably wish she had the capability to divorce my father, take her children, and run away at this time.

My brother graduated and attended Whitney Young Magnet High School, my sister attended Jones College Prep, and I worked my way up to the eighth grade in a uselessly, disgustingly prejudiced “gifted program” I was forcibly assigned to by the school. I believe that my brain subconsciously disables and blurs memories of this period as a self-defense mechanism, but there was probably continuous physical abuse, emotional abuse, and neglect of the sort mentioned prior. However, for this period, it would also include the deterioration of my older brother’s mental health. He would soon develop multiple different anxiety disorders (he never obtained a professional diagnosis at this time, but I am using my own observations to best explain what I witnessed). He became obsessed with gaming as an extremely detrimental coping mechanism, and would play upwards to 12 hours a day or more, while also quickly becoming angered whenever provoked. This anger would soon turn into something along the lines of Intermittent Explosive Disorder (as a Psychology major, I always hate assigning disorders loosely with criteria, but I must do this for the sake of befitting synopsis and succinctness). Once my brother and sister graduated, they then went to college at UIUC, where before they left, they comforted me as I cried despite being in eighth grade. I don’t know why I cried. I like to think it was because I would miss them, but perhaps there was also fear, reluctance, and the beginning of my abandonment issues. 

While they were gone to UIUC, I successfully entered Whitney Young, also. I know that this is a horrible mentality, but I felt that it was my responsibility as the youngest child who bore “the least trauma” to therefore mediate my two parents while my older siblings were busy attempting to forge their own lives despite our abused upbringing. What I didn’t know was that, behind the scenes, my older brother’s mental state was still worsening while my older sister had to ironically bear another form of abuse from him while somehow maintaining her own sanity and grades. My brother obviously graduated first with a bachelor’s degree in economics, but when he returned, he immediately began to experience a period of dissociation while trying his best to fix himself, jumping from part-time job to part-time job, until he couldn’t endure it anymore. 

He eventually destroyed the home, punching holes in the door/wall, etc., just as our father did, and I blamed him for it. I hated him at the time. I would run away to seek refuge at the local park, in the local library, or even camp inside the 24-hours CVS Pharmacy every day after high school since I was fearful of seeing my own older brother. When I inevitably had to return home late at night, I would try my best to mediate between my brother and father, since my father would trigger his episodes. I tried my best to handle everything since I wanted my sister to fully focus on herself, her education, and for her to at least have the ability to finish her degree and focus on her own life with temporary relief from our living hell at the time. But soon, after my brother said he wanted to kill himself, I couldn’t take it anymore and broke down one night when I had a video call with my older sister. She was forced to come back and forth between college and home multiple times to help with interventions.

Once my sister graduated with her bachelor’s in food science and human nutrition, my brother tried his best to stabilize. The three of us began to get together at the local library to help research and contact apartments to quickly move our mother out and try to forge our own lives and fix everything for our family. Eventually we successfully convinced and moved our mom out.

Then my sister moved out after my father broke her last straw by “disowning her” (despite her leaving of her own accord, technically) during his prodromal stage. 

Then it was just me, my older brother, and father. 

A few weeks later, my older brother looked me in the eyes with a distraught expression that I can still somehow vividly remember even now. So, I put on my most assured but fake smile and told him that everything would be okay. I told him that he could leave, too. I said that I could handle our father, since as the youngest child, our dad never really did, and would not do anything to me. So far, it might seem like I hated my older brother. But no. I do still love him, even now, while he is gone from this world already.

Fuck, tears are falling down uncontrollably now already, again, fuck. 

My brother, mother, and sister pitched together to move into an apartment closer to where I was currently living (alone with my father). I would spend the days performing chores to help my mentally unsound father, going to a tutoring gig, concentrating on AP classes, and inevitably visiting my siblings/mother without letting my father know every month or so. 

This continued until my junior year of highschool. I woke up with a call from my older sister one day. She didn’t tell me what was wrong, but insisted that I needed to come see her and our mother. My heart was palpitating when I ran to the bus stop. Everyone in the bus stared at me as if I was an insane person as I kept trying to speak to myself to calm down. I was in denial. I was hopeful. I kept making excuses, such as how my sister would have told me outright if what I was thinking was truly the case.

I broke down immediately when I found out he committed suicide by hanging in the basement of their apartment. 

What was worse was how he attempted to see me one last time the night before, but I was gone tutoring late. The last time I had seen him was a month before his fucking suicide, where he asked awkwardly if I could hug him. Our family has never shown each other true affection, so I brushed it off like a fucking idiot. Why didn’t I do so, and then take a walk to the park like we used to do when I was young before things went to shit?

After he committed suicide, I mustered my courage and went with my older sister to confront our father about what happened. My sister, also a hard worker, was struggling and working a job three hours away in commute while facing her own crises. So, after our father seemingly broke down but recovered, she left me back alone with him for the next several days. However, my father’s condition again was triggered and worsened. He began to experience tics, perseveration, and other schizophrenic symptomatology. Since it was worsening, my sister was forced to come back from her work to stay overnight to keep me safe. The next day, she told me to stay put as she confronted him to find that he had been cutting himself on the wrists that night, before running upstairs and saying that we had to leave. My father ran after us, stating that he and I should die together to “join my older brother”. We went to the police station temporarily to see if he would follow us in, before carefully taking the train to my high school.

The more I explain this, the more I feel numb. I am elongating this far too much, I know, but my emotions are turbulent and I need to vent.

My sister and I explained everything to all the counselors there, who then contacted DCFS, where I eventually (after endless court cases) became a Ward of the State. We obtained a restraining order while being forced to abandon our father and his side of the family for our own safety.

We moved far away with our mother to seek refuge and try to recover ourselves. Since I shortly entered UIUC, my older sister was forced to handle the funeral arrangements, arguments with my slightly abusive mother (verbal abuse is nevertheless abuse), and her attempts to find another job. 

Unfortunately, she has been unemployed for almost six years. Four years were wasted fixing things for this broken family. The other two years were her hard work and efforts to find new skills such as successfully obtaining certification from a UI/UX Academy, since she realized how she hated dietetics. My sister is the most resilient, pragmatic, and capable person I know. But two years of job interviewers turning her down, have hurt her. She’s tried her best. It’s either she explains the truth behind her unemployment gap to employers, or she doesn’t. If she does tell the truth, what kind of employers would want someone with this type of fucked up background and upbringing? If she doesn’t tell the truth, how can she possibly keep putting up a fake face and smile that destroys her mental health further?

Three days ago, my mother was crying as she told my sister that we are going to be in thousands of dollars of debt, and potentially tens of thousands of dollars of debt in the future, due to building code violations in the old house (with endless traumatic memories) that my father has resided in the past two years. My mother’s name is still on the deed since she never divorced our father out of both fear and lack of education. He has apparently been hoarding trash around the entire sidewalk and destroying the property this entire time, likely due to his condition. The court has docket photos that have made this evident. This debt has implicated us, obviously, since her name is on the deed.

My mother, in her desperation, attempted to reconnect and call one of our relatives we trust, my older cousin, to finally take matters into her own hands and get a divorce with my father. This was already an insane risk, for obvious reasons, and one of our final options and last resort. The call back was gaslighting, stating that my mother should come back and be with my father, that my older sister is an adult and should know how to take care of herself, and that I should go back to apologize to my father. My own father attempted to potentially murder me, and I also lost my older brother due to complications with him. None of them ever helped my family throughout every single one of my father's or brother's episodes. In fact, I remember my father handing one of my cousins his cash from his wallet during an instance in which his symptoms flared up, one time, in which they didn’t even pause as they took his money without question. How dare they. How dare they have the gall to tell us what to do when so much has been practically taken and lost from us.

Right now, I am stuck here in college while my sister is about to meet with our last hope, a lawyer, to consult about whether “quit claim deeds” require the grantee’s signature so that hopefully we can just cut off the property and future debt payments without needing to meet our father physically. Obviously, my mother has to change her phone number also, to avoid being potentially harassed, stalked, or even worse by our father. As my sister and I suspected, but hoped would not be the case, our relatives on our father’s side are cut off from our lives now.

My sister broke down in a call with me last night, saying that she doesn’t know how much more she can take. That she feels stuck but knows she has to live and keep surviving for my own sake. She knows this, but she told me that she had to let me know that she thought of suicide for the first time uncontrollably.

My sister and I have almost no support systems. My sister and I have no close relationships with any relatives. My sister has no friends and has estranged herself from all coworkers the past eight years, for the reasons I stated above. Our fortitude and attempts to even live… to live happily… and to live normally have taken a toll over time. There is only so much resilience a person can have. No matter how much we attempt to escape our past, issues always come up that implicate us to remind us that we will never be able to have actual happiness.

I have witnessed too much that has whittled away my faith and will to live slowly.

By no means am I extrapolating this to every policeman, but I have witnessed officers laughing at my father’s manic episode and abandoning the premises as the three children cried. 

I have witnessed the failure of this country’s mental healthcare system when my brother and father were hospitalized multiple times but released without proper treatment as they signed themselves out. By no means am I fully aware of our mental healthcare policies, but what I do know is that it did not help avoid this current situation.

When I was young, I witnessed my sister’s high school “friends” laugh at her issues and say that they didn’t believe her. That even if the issues were real, they couldn’t do anything to help. 

I have witnessed abandonment by my relatives, abandonment by my own family at times (but I forgive them), the suicide of my brother who was forced to face facets of abuse and adulthood ever since he was only fucking eight years old, the struggles and attempts to live by my sister, and the aging/suffering of my mother from losing her firstborn by suicide.

I have visited three therapists, one by reaching out to my own caseworker before I “exited” the DCFS system, one of my own volition/search near my home, and one here on campus after attempting to make an appointment three times in a row. All three would look in disbelief as I divulged everything, while unintentionally having me brush over my issues via generalizing questions/commentary. I know they probably meant well, and perhaps I have confirmation biases of my own. Perhaps I simply need to keep reaching out. However, none have helped nor provided tangible resources/suggestions. 

I have witnessed some school faculty (I will not disclose names for obvious reasons) in my high school purposefully avoid me simply on the basis of my problems and struggles once it became known. One of them, who helped comfort me at the crisis of my dad’s breakdown, also didn’t say anything and went the other direction with a fearful expression when I encountered them in the hallway coincidentally weeks later. I can’t forget that moment, for some reason. 

My sister always would laugh in self-ridicule, saying that technically, not once has our family ever had a happy memory. I would argue that us three siblings did have memories that I still try to cling onto. But, I can’t help but cry sometimes when I remember how she told me that she can’t actually remember some of them, whether it is due to her trauma, or some other sort of mental facet.

I don’t know what to do. I don’t. I can’t anymore. 

Maybe some part of me still has an inkling of hope left, that allows me to subsist. Today, I will wait for my sister to convey information about the lawyer. 

If worse comes to worst, I need to hurry and graduate so I can move out with my sister. I also hope that I can keep contact and help my mother out simultaneously (if the issue is resolvable), but I am distraught right now.

My sister and I always wanted us three siblings to one day just live together and try to help lift each other back on our feet. I don’t want to abandon that dream we had when young. I don’t want to lose her too. I realized that I haven’t valued enough time, haven't spent enough experiences, and truly have not taken what I have remaining for granted, prior to this point. 

If you have read to this point, thank you. I want to at least leave some remembrance, even if anonymously, perhaps for my older brother I've lost, perhaps for my own sake, or to simply keep myself from deteriorating further at this moment. I know that this is probably futile, and that I am probably only typing this to temporarily either preserve my sanity or give myself solace. 

I think I am a resilient person, but to a detriment. Maybe I will later regret making this post, or writing this to begin with. My family has always been fearful and distrustful of divulging any of our history. I am tired of it being kept inside me. I probably will try to reach out for the first time and reveal everything for the first time to the only few individuals I might be able to trust. The truth is, however, I am always afraid to reach out. I still don't even know why I am typing this right now.

For some reason, the rational or, maybe, hopeful side of me is saying to stop typing and delete this. The rational side of me is saying that my resilient sister will be fine, and that she will recover just like the times before when she broke down the tens of times before. That maybe I will just laugh at what I am doing right now, in the future, if things somehow work out. But no. I know that is wrong, and that I should not be ashamed nor scared to reveal my past anymore. That is part of the problem in my way of thinking, in my family's way of thinking, that may have led to this point.

[Several rooms have been flooded](https://reddit.com/link/zw46nr/video/7emujr9ilc8a1/player)

It is said that the series of events began on floor 9th, when an individual failed to properly secure the window before departing for Christmas break, which resulted in the freezing and rupture of a pipe. Subsequently, the flooding of power lines triggered multiple fire alarms and the activation of fire sprinklers. As the manager failed to respond to our attempts at communication and the maintenance team was left with only a single person in charge during the holiday, who lived two hours from the IT department and initially did not deem the circumstance urgent enough to warrant immediate attention, the situation rapidly deteriorated and snowballed out of control.

In light of previous incidents - including, but not limited to, the provision of unpalatable cuisine, the promulgation of waste disposal fines, and the numerous dismissal of requests from current occupants - the happening of this catastrophic leaking has raised residence-wide anger and outrage. The continuation of Illini Tower's mediocre reputation and future revenue is unlikely, as they are headed for decline.

&#x200B;

To prevent future losses, I was encouraged to share this information with as many individuals as possible, and I hope you can do the same.

&#x200B;

Like what in every Illini Alert goes:

Our Community. Our Safety.

&#x200B;

Best,

A heartbroken resident at IT

He was a bit awkward at first when I first met him and he didn't talk much. I noticed he had some kind of animal costume in his closet one time and thought it was for Halloween or something. Everything was generally okay up until the point he talked to me about ""furries"" and I thought it was alright, not for me, but do your own thing, you know? After this however, he started wearing it in the dorm while talking to his friends online. I usually have headphones on and our desks are facing away from each other, so it didn't really bother me too much, it was kind of weird though. 

Anyways, I told him I was gonna have a friend over to do calc homework, so I figured he would take off his fursuit when I went to go down and let my friend in, but when I opened the door, he was standing right in front of it and said something along the lines of, ""Hi X's friend! I'm Y, his fuzzy roommate!"" I was shocked at this display, I saw my friend looking wide eyed, not knowing what to say, so I just said, ""we'll be right back"" and we just went into the study room down the hall and just pretended it never happened. I had no idea how to address it in the first place. After that, I went back to my dorm and told him that it seemed a little much to do that kind of thing in front of strangers and he said okay, but he seemed very sad, so I assumed he got the message. 

Unfortunately, he did not, and when I told him that a few friends were coming over to watch some videos, there he was again, but this time he was sitting at his chair and just said, ""Hi."" It was an improvement, but he was still wearing his fursuit... I just told my friends it was for some kind of project and shrugged it off. We were watching YouTube videos on my laptop for about an hour and throughout that my roommate was talking to his friends quietly and would occasionally make strange animal noises and my friends started glancing at him.

I didn't know what to say to him after my friends left, but this has got to stop. I don't know if it makes him feel more at home to wear his fursuit, or if he's acting differently because he's in a new place?

65,zxkzow,fucksmileliving,563.0,0.99,24,UIUC,"Thank you so much on the response on my previous post! I wanted to provide an update to everyone and let you know how Smile tried to make us take responsibility for things they are responsible for and how at the end of the day knowing our rights as tenant in the City of Urbana saved our ass.

&#x200B;

**Summary of what happened:** Pipe burst last saturday somewhere on the top floor. Tenants informed smile but they didn't immediately shut down the fire system water and it leaked for two days flooding about 10 apartments and corridors. Smile shut down domestic water since Saturday and asked tenants to move out.  Multiple units ceilings collapsed and entire units were water soaked with damages to physical items and possible mold growth.

&#x200B;

**What Smile did:** When Smile asked people to move out, they initially said they will cover hotel until Wednesday. Later they said emails that said the tenants have to contact their rental insurances. Even for some residents like me whose unit was completely damaged, they said I have to figure out my own accommodation until the unit is fixed (no timeline) paying out of pocket. For those whose unit was not damaged but had no running water, Smile did not provide any timeline and left people to figure out themselves. Marisa was the manager who backtracked on her words and communicated with tenants. She claimed that can take as long as they can to fix things and that they are in no way responsible for paying for alternative accommodation. While all of this happened, they send generic messages like ""working tirelessy to getting things fixed asap with all effort"" while in reality there was minimal activity near apartment to fix things and they didn't even take the effort to dry out units and corridor leading to mold growth from the apparent musty smell. Also note that a lot of tenants in my building are new international students who don't completely know what their rights as a tenant are.

&#x200B;

**What tenants did:** A fellow tenant who is smart enough to read the Urbana ordinance contacted the City of Urbana. Urbana ordinance says that if the landlord is not able to provide essential services or if the unit is uninhabitable the tenant can deduct average hotel price from rent. The folks from Urbana office of inspectors reached out promptly and informed the tenants that Smile is absolutely responsible for providing alternatives until the damages in the unit is fixed and until the water is back up. They also let Smile know to stop misleading the tenants about their rights!

Thanks Mike, Nick from the City of Urbana and thanks to my fellow tenants who spend time into collecting all info, knowing the rights, and reaching out to the City!

&#x200B;

FUCK SMILE STUDENT LIVING!

BTW: Signing this petition is very easy! You do NOT need to create a change.org account; all you need is a Facebook or Gmail. The process takes less than a minute. Thanks :)

2) Beckman is a beautiful study space with working charging wall plugs and numerous desk space and group study places on all floors. Watch out tho, cause it's not open to us on the weekends and access closes at 6PM on weekdays. 

3) Apply for access to Seibel whenever u join a CS class. VR, 225, 173, it doesn't fucking matter. Get access to seibel, it'll be super helpful over time. 

4) CS classes are free. Like crazy free. 173, 225 are very rudimentary. 374 is free if you take it with Mahesh Vishwanathan. CS 4xx classes are jokes so take them as much as possible for tech electives. 

CS 410 had 4 MPs on which I spent less than an hour each, weekly quizzes which took 2 hours to study for, no exams or finals. The final project was free too. 

CS 460 with Bambenek is extremely interesting, and easy enough if you put in the weekly work (decent amount 10-20 hours especially if you're like me and don't know any security). No exams, quizzes, or finals. 

CS 498 classes are usually super easy, such as Digital forensics and case in point VR, AML which I will talk about next. 

5) For CEs take VR and AML for your advanced electives. AML has no exams or finals, and VR has two exams but is free apart from those (the exams can be studied for the day before). No finals. 

6) EE and CE can interchange majors pretty easily. If you want to relax and live a comfortable life doing no work and sitting back making 6 figures while working 10 hours a week tops at a fortune 500, switch over to CE and take as many CS classes as possible. 

7) NETWORK. Fuck me. ECE is full of snakes and tattletalers. Ignore them. The vast majority of them are useless. That one dude who is aight, doesn't really know his shit but can talk a big game? Yeah he's goin places. Stick with em. The best way to get hired as an intern is to be refereed in. Find chill peeps at these companies go grab a beer. 

8) You better get a hundo on all CBTF exams. There's absolutely no reason not to. If you can't u need to find a better group or infiltrate one of the chineese. 

9) GYM. The arc is chillin right there. GO. 

10) Leetcode like a motherfucker. 1000 problems. u have them memorized? that's gg you can get any software position at any company globally. 

11) Startups are hard work, boring, irritating, and annoying. 99% of people are gonna lose money. Stay the fuck away, sit back with ur 6 figures at a fortune 5 hundo, and enjoy the benefits. 

12) ECE classes are annoying. Conflicts are the same exams. Network, use ur resources. Teachers recycle exams. 391, 411, all have problems from past exams. Get previous exams from past semesters which the profs haven't made available. Frats and chineese have the banks of these.

Champaign, and especially the area of Green St near campus, is full of students that don’t have cars or simply walk to get around, which is one of my favorite parts of living here. So it begs the question, why do we even need cars on Green St between 1st and Wright? Most of the businesses along this stretch are accessed exclusively by pedestrians, and there are plenty of other roads that cars could take to get along the same path (i.e. Springfield or University). Not to mention all the jackasses that rev their muscle cars insanely loud down Green St just to show off and destroy everyone else’s ears. If Champaign banned all private vehicles and only allowed public transit and delivery vehicles on this road, it would be way safer and enjoyable for pedestrians and bikers.

Instead, he essentially interrogated me in front of my co-workers, even asking questions about if I had any tattoos and such despite the fact that it was clearly not a crime.

Here’s info specific to Illinois when being stopped by police when not driving (a traffic stop does require you to carry and produce ID):\n\nhttps://www.illinoislegalaid.org/legal-information/if-i-carry-id-do-i-have-identify-myself\n\nAlways remember the following if you are stopped for suspicion of a crime:\n\n- Ask what you’re being stopped for or what crime you’re suspected of committing.\n- Ask if you’re being detained or if you are free to go. If police say you’re free to go, leave, end of story. If you’re being detained:\n- Invoke your 5th amendment right to remain silent after truthfully identifying yourself (if identification is required). You cannot simply remain silent, you must proactively and verbally invoke this right. “I am invoking my 5th amendment right to remain silent.”\n- Once you invoke your right to remain silent… remain silent. If the police intended to arrest you from the beginning, you’ll be arrested no matter what you say, and answering questions will only provide them evidence for the original or additional charges that otherwise couldn’t be made. If they were merely questioning you, they’ll either leave you be or ask you to leave the area (which you should do). \n\nYour situation sounds fairly straight forward, and it always feels easier to simply comply and be friendly than to invoke your rights against an authority figure. Ultimately it’s up to the individual how they choose to interact with the police, however too few people (including myself at one time) realize that they have rights they can invoke and that they should not be treated like a convicted criminal simply for being in public.', 'score': 137, 'created_utc': 1664289178.0}, {'author': 'CarbineFox', 'body': '[Where do you fit on this scale?](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DLJyglKW4AA4i1B?format=jpg&name=900x900)', 'score': 61, 'created_utc': 1664305216.0}, {'author': 'twowatersandapear', 'body': 'From the police scanner: ""There\'s a biracial male wearing a baseball hat.

88,kd9tp7,brownassbitch666,527.0,0.91,193,UIUC,"Hear ye hear ye, I am yet another salty CS student in this subreddit, ready to complain. CS culture may not deserve this much attention, but given my personal experiences and upheavals this semester, I think it's high time I come out as **disappointed.**

When I was a freshman, I felt like all of the people around me exuded obsession and prided themselves in it - ""I stayed up all night just to finish my MP!!!"" and as someone who suffers from test anxiety, I always felt insecure for not obsessing over the MPs or doing all that well on exams. Funnily enough, I do like eating three meals a day, going to bed at 11:30 PM, waking up at 9 AM, and talking about things besides internships! What a shocker lol.

Funnily enough, I don't always need to flex; in fact, I probably put more effort into uplifting my friends than I do myself. Funnily enough, I don't need to make inappropriate jokes just to make my friends laugh, and I certainly don't need to make inappropriate jokes to think people like me.

Funnily enough, I don't need to dismiss people's concerns about my attitude to maintain my ego; I actually don't think there's anything wrong with apologizing, accepting that I can always be kinder and more respectful, and *actively* trying to be a better fucking person.

I think that, this semester, the CS culture has had an obnoxious flair-up of douchery because of everything being online. Being online makes a lot of people feel like they can get away with certain bullshittery (I wish this was an actual word), and I've just seen a lot of indirect shade, toxicity, and just, general negativity. Whether this is on Piazza or in group chats, I've felt isolated and annoyed at everyone around me at times. At the same time, I'm less tolerant and more vocal these days because I also use the Internet to my own advantage, i.e. I can be angry on the Internet a lot easier than I can in real life. I guess we're all culprits in this manner? But I digress because unlike a lot of the people around me, I've never stopped trying to understand how to respect others and show kindness rather than defend themselves.

I lost a lot of fake friends this semester. I lost someone who took their own life this summer. I lost myself and am slowly rebuilding the things that make me, me. After years of dealing with anxiety and depression and finally gaining the strength to seek help, I understand that I don't have to be ok with bullshit anymore. Yes, to a certain extent, speaking up all the time is obnoxious, but I'm on the other end of that spectrum, aren't I?

I'm tired of the egoism, toxic masculinity, sexism, racism, and all forms of gaslighting in CS culture! I've put up with it for two years, and because of my career goals, I'll continue to put up with it for the rest of my life. If my distaste means losing a lot of friends, so be it! I don't want to constantly be undermined and told that I'm ""overreacting"" and ""being mean"" for speaking up after MONTHS of feeling uncomfortable in a social setting.

I'm especially tired of ""ha-haing"" obsession in this field. Working all day and all night does not make you a champ, it simply means you're busy. My peers left and right are flexing about dumb shit when, in fact, I lose respect for them the more they brag. Working hard isn't a bragging right, but surviving is. I just LOVE how these people in my classes find new, innovative, technologically advanced strategies to tackling insecurities and the CS food chain!

This alienation of others, of people who may not yet have a fucking junior year internship, of people who may not come from a beautiful Chicago suburb but in fact from a low-income town, of people who can't just hide their mental and physical scars like those who speak loudly, has simply got to stop. Will it? No, probably not, but to those who feel alienated right now, you're not alone.

Regardless of what the people with big sticks say, we're all fortunate to be here, and we're all doing our damn fucking best. We're trying to make this fucking world a better fucking place for future generations of humans, dogs, and all the animals. We're all meant to be here, we're all meant to be **proud of ourselves**, and we're all allowed to speak the HELL up when someone brings you down.

As a Physics major who is doing a CS minor, when I was in CS 125 last semester, I did receive help from some nice people (like Ben Nordick), but there were also many arrogant course staffs who are being not very helpful and patient. However, I've never seen such situation in the Physics community; ppl were always trying their best helping each other. I guess here is the reason that makes the different:\n\nFor Physics majors, everyone is fucked up by Physics. No matter how smart you are, there's always something that you don't know. So we are aware that there's something beyond our limits and we tend to not to flex on each other.\n\nIn CS, some people think they are smart and look short on the others because they are in CS, this most selective major in UIUC and they are (possibly) gonna earn 6 figure as fresh grads. However, admission into CS being selective is not because of the knowledge is hard. If that is the case, then Physics, aeroE and EE are going to be the most selective majors in engineering. Rather, it's because people are crowded into CS. Getting a decent wage is also not due to intellectual sharpness, but rather a high average in the industry. The huge shortage in CS grad supply boots up people's ego and creates wrong impression of themselves in some CS people's minds.\n\nI think the main reason accouting for the toxic culture is that some CS ppl have really limited scopes. In their worlds, there are only score of a MP, internship placement, or grades in CS 374. They only interact with people in the community, and they only talk about classes, internships, and programming languages. They compare with others to fulfill their ego. However, there are much more things to learn in this world and they ignore them all.\n\nAlso being a CA in CS 101, given that I've witnessed the toxic culture in CS, I tried my best to provide useful help and being patient. Although some questions seemed obvious and easy and some students couldn't get it for the first time, I always explained in details while being patient until the student understands. I am aware that no one was born with programming skills, and all of us learned it from 'hello world'. A course staff's job is to provide students with encouragement, instead of showing the students they are better than them."", 'score': 10, 'created_utc': 1608030812.0}, {'author': 'bearsfan654', 'body': ""OP, I think you nailed this perfectly. I guess I'm a bit of an old geezer around here (super-senior because of my double major in Political Science to add on to my Stats and CS major), but I think everything you have written is extremely accurate about the CS culture and how it has been cultivated over the last few years. To be fair, I can't speak for how the culture has been like this semester because I was working on a political campaign the past few months (which even though it was my dream job, some peers in the department ridiculed me because it wasn't a tech industry job). That being said, your sentiment is most definitely accurate given my past experiences.\n\nThere is an absolute ton of gaslighting, toxic masculinity, egoism, you name it, in the computer science culture here, and I have been in the exact same boat as you. It's ironic, because at any place I've worked at (not trying to brag about any career achievements but listing these to showcase my sentiment remains intact across a wide variety of industries - in fintech, at a FAANG company, for the US government in both the halls of Congress and doing tech at one of the executive branch agencies, and on financial data on a political campaign), not one of these places comes close to the gaslighting, toxic masculinity, and negativity that I have seen during my years here. Not even close. But imagine that for a second - **you know your major's culture is absolutely and massively fucked up** if the halls of *the United States Congress* have less gaslighting, toxicity, and egoism than what is produced by your peers in a computer science department. It is pathetic, immature, ignorant, and quite frankly - small. The University of Illinois is a world-class university, and this is the absolute fucking best we apparently have to offer in terms of computer science culture? Wow.\n\nSo, *at the very least*, this culture is not as existent in the real world (especially if you don't work in FAANG, which to be honest is quite overrated and the perks get old real quick). **As long as you surround yourself with the right people here and in the real world, the experiences that you've had in tech here at U of I won't be as bad once you graduate**. My sentiment is similar with interning too: I've found my intern and work colleagues to be way less participative of these qualities than my U of I computer science peers, and when I've talked previously about how these qualities are a problem, my colleagues were appalled that it was THIS bad).\n\nThe tech bro culture here is a rampant disease that becomes more consuming the longer you stay here, and time and time again I've seen people fall into it. Just sharing personal experiences, but I've had close friends who were at one point against that culture get extremely jealous when I got an internship offer at a FAANG company, and who told other people I was going to fail just to deal with their own insecurity. I've been mocked for wanting to go down my own path and take an extra semester to double major in a field I have been passionate about since I was a child, rather than go into FAANG like everyone else. I have also been told I was overreacting or being mean when I didn't like the culture that the university was cultivating. I know of people who literally mocked other University of Illinois students for NOT being in computer science.\n\nI understand your experiences and your pain because I have been there, and you and others are not alone in feeling this alienation and feeling disconnected and disappointed as a result.\n\nIt took me a while to accept my peace with the culture here. I don't hold any grudges and I'm not mad. Yet to this day, it is still absolutely mind-boggling how many students in the department judge another human being by their standards of success and their timeline rather than that human's standards of success and that human's timeline. The number of people who will ridicule others who don't get a FAANG internship or a job on the West Coast during their time here amazes me. *Who the fuck cares?* That lack of understanding leads to massive lapses in ethics and caring. The department and the student body absolutely needs to do something about it, and I don't think a simple one-hour conversation is something that will cover it. Unfortunately, a massive shift in culture like this will probably have to take years, long after we graduate.\n\nOne of the only ways to escape this elitism and toxic mentality that occurs in this department is to surround yourself with different experiences and with different people. Some of the ways that I found that I grew the most as a student and more importantly, as a person, was by escaping the constant FAANG-obsessed mob mentality and doing things out of my comfort zone. I made my closest friendships here with people who weren't in computer science. I did a study program in Washington, DC (Illinois in Washington) and lived with a bunch of political science students who to this day are some of my closest buddies (even though I'm way more of a CS student than a political science one). Heck, when I was deciding between two locations to intern when I flirted with FAANG, I chose the location where I wouldn't be by my college friends so I could grow as a person, meet new people, and have different experiences with different people. Even if you don't have the luxury of studying or working in a different field or place, taking yourself out of the constant 24/7 tech grind does wonders to your emotional maturity and your mental health.\n\nLooking back, that lack of finding new experiences and surrounding oneself with people of different backgrounds holds back the CS culture here. Sure, one gets to grow a coding skillset, but who fucking cares? You don't get to grow as a person, and because you're surrounded with this echo chamber of elitism, egoism, and toxicity and because you're constantly surrounded by the same people, this constant competitiveness and constant desire to prove that you're better than everyone else and to bring down other people who don't follow your path becomes rampant. Interact less with toxic peers and more with people of different backgrounds, and you'll be able to combat the CS environment with a wide variety of amazing experiences."", 'score': 28, 'created_utc': 1608015301.0}]","{'neg': 0.129, 'neu': 0.667, 'pos': 0.204, 'compound': 0.9977}",0.204,0.129,0.9977

92,gv7dnl,bigcdv32,593.0,0.95,100,UIUC,"I have been seeing a lot of posts recently that have called out this subreddit, saying that ""by not supporting looting, you are not supporting the movement"" As a black man from a low-income neighborhood, I can understand that feeling of anger, even if personally I may not agree with it. I do feel like it affects many innocent people (business owners, shoppers, etc), and their livelihoods should be taken into consideration too. 

The overall consensus I feel is that the vast majority of people here support equal rights, and want to find peaceful ways to do it. I would agree with that. I feel like there is a problem with carrying a more centrist view on this matter, as it makes people who are really passionate about this issue feel like ""you don't care"". I just want to remind people that it is okay to feel conflicted. It is okay to support the message, but not all of methods. This is a serious topic, and one that is very new to a lot of us. Emotions are high, and people are rightfully angry, and people show that in different ways, which could be both beneficial and detrimental to the cause.

With that being said, I want to provide, not a counterpoint, but an alternate way of thinking about the looting/rioting. Again, I do not think it is a good idea, and there are probably a lot of people looting that are not really for the cause, I can admit that. However, imagine the people who are rioting/protesting, who feel like this is their only way to send a message. I can say that peaceful protests/pushing for policies are the best course of action, but I also have the benefit of going to college, which gave me this opportunity to find a ""way out"" of my neighborhood. If all goes well post-graduation, I can support myself and my family with my career of choice. A lot of people in these protests do not feel like they have this opportunity. They are fueled by so much anger, for injustice, for not having a voice, for being stuck in a cycle of poverty that their parents and grandparents were in, that they feel this is their only way to have a ""voice"" is to violently protest. If I were in their shoes, I would do whatever I can to prevent this issue from becoming another non-issue in two weeks time.

For the people that say ""there are healthier, more legal ways to show support"" Yes I agree, but I want to provide another perspective:

One of the problems, especially in the black community, is that there is this emphasis on ""keeping emotions in"". A lot of black people (including myself) were conditioned to not show emotions, its a sign of weakness, and sadly that is what we did. Every injustice or pain that we felt, we internalized and moved on. There is going to come a time where all those emotions come out. and you become fueled by it. It is the driving force behind everything that you are fighting for, and with that, that might be some of the motivation behind why people feel justified to loot. Do I think it is a valid excuse? No, but I also have had the benefit to better cope with these feelings. Through therapy and medication from the university, I got to talk about these feelings, and find alternative, healthier ways to cope with it. Very few people have that benefit. Now this can open up a whole different discussion on the importance of mental health in impoverished communities, but that is a topic for a different day. (Sorry I'm a Psych major, I had to bring that side up :-)

You might be reading all of this and be thinking ""I am confused. What was the point of all this?"". The point is that there are so many different perspectives on this matter. I feel like we all (except trolls) support the message of ending police brutality, but we want to support it in a peaceful way. In times like this, it is important to hear all perspectives, not as an excuse, but just to get a better understanding. I feel like most of you are willing to listen, and I guess I was trying to provide those alternate perspectives, just in a more respectful, less accusatory way. Stay safe Illini!

However, if you\'re willing to listen, I\'d want to provide insight as to how many on my side (centrist) see this issue.\n\nTo preface: I am 100% privileged, and grew up with none of the struggles and fears that the black community faces. I fully agree with the message of the black lives matter movement and believe that changes need to be made to the systems that have oppressed black people for so long.\n\nThat being said though, when instances like these happen, it is becoming increasingly tough to understand how to provide unwavering support to the black community because in a weird way, we face backlash regardless of what we do. If we say too little: ""inaction is part of the problem and you\'re complicit in oppressing black people"". If we say ANYTHING more than just black lives matter we are told ""It is not your place, check your privilege."" As much as we want to help, navigating issues like these are becoming increasingly difficult, and frankly, frustrating because despite however good our intentions might be, they seem to always be misconstrued. I genuinely want to know what is an acceptable amount to help and what are things we can do without being told we are ""entitled and privileged"".\n\nThe second thing I want to address is why it is tough to understand the need for looting/violent rioting right now regardless of the intention. I have no problem with rioting if it is aimed towards the systems that have oppressed black people (burn a cop car for all I care, that\'s actually symbolic). But when it extends to businesses with no relevance to the issue, businesses that are already struggling due to the pandemic, businesses that employ members of oppressed communities, it is very hard to justify those actions. Many peaceful protestors have denounced those who are taking advantage of the situation and have said that they are a misrepresentation of the movement. I agree with that. But then you can\'t vilify the police for going after looters and rioters. Civil disobedience is a first amendment right, anarchy is not.\n\nThe last thing I want to address is what comes next. I think the reason that these protests are starting lose their meaning to many is because it seems aimless. Yes, black lives matter. Yes, those cops need to be charged and face consequences for their actions. The response to George Floyd\'s murder was completely justified. But now what? Those cops are facing second degree murder charges/aiding and abetting. The entire country (and pretty much the entire world) is listening but no one is offering any solution. If congress went up to a group of protesters right now and said ""we will work to meet your demands,"" how many people would actually have a course of action? I\'m sorry if this seems insensitive but I hope you can understand why these protests are starting to seem aimless. The difference between this and protests of the past is that there was a clear leader and a clear legal goal in mind. MLK led the civil rights movement and demanded that the laws for segregation be overturned. Right now, the unfortunate reality is that the media attention is on the anarchy and lawlessness. There doesn\'t seem to be a clear direction to where this is going. I genuinely want to educate myself and hopefully others on what solutions members of the black community want to see implemented. (Saying fuck 12 is not a solution. We need cops.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOverall, please don\'t label people who hold a centrist view racist. If you take a step back and look at this problem as a whole, the systems can\'t be changed without proper legal discourse. Proper legal discourse can\'t be achieved until political leaders, cops, and society in general understand what the demands are. Then everyone can work together to find a solution but unless people stop the riots and anarchy, unless people clearly identify what they want out of these protests, unless actual conversations are had, it will be very hard for change to occur.

But law of large numbers says that with a student population of over 50k (or whatever percentage of them are on campus even if only like 20-25k,) there\'s most undoubtedly going to be a small group who will behave like the anti-maskers and the ""reopen"" ""protestors.""\n\nAlso... I just fucking thought of this:\n\nThink of how the bars encourage the absolute crap out of unofficial. Ppl have died several times from that supposed tradition, and the local bars and other kinds of private businesses actually have shirts and other bullshit manufactured for it, and milk profit out of unofficial in many ways.\n\nIf basically left to their own devices, it\'s naive to think that the bars would really take COVID very seriously if it cuts into their duckets.\n\nAt this point, I don\'t honestly know the answer, so take what you will from these thoughts.', 'score': 110, 'created_utc': 1599354952.0}, {'author': 'CookieKiller369', 'body': 'Honestly, the university did almost everything they could to make a safe environment for Fall 2020, so I think most of the fault does go to the students who party, not them.', 'score': 76, 'created_utc': 1599356569.0}, {'author': 'None', 'body': 'I 100% agree.

There are much deeper flaws within one’s development and environment at hand that cause that or else we’d be living in a utopia.

I’m not the university, nor am I some sort of high IQ strategist able to come up with the proper solutions, but from what I keep seeing, finger wagging, shame from peers, and threatening to send everyone home again are not effective in making individuals compliant in regards to following some simple rules to prevent a spike in positive cases due to gathering and partying.\n\nThis is all based on the hearsay and mass mails I’ve read so far. Maybe I’m all wrong and the university is making some active strides and people are taking the rules seriously, but so far I still see people complaining about gatherings and partying and their shit roommates that keep going out whimsically as if it were 2019 still. Until I start seeing big news that people are being effectively reprimanded and parties start to quell, I’m gonna assume that nothing is being done. \n\nTL;DR: Yes, it’s the college students’ faults if they aren’t following rules.

I ended up running home and calling the police. I just wanted to make a PSA in case anyone sees this guy in Urbana.

Don't freak out. Please. It's not the end of the world, I promise. Being on probation doesn't mean a guaranteed drop. It's really an opportunity to re-assess your wellbeing and academic habits, and see if you need to change something or get help, or maybe lighten your workload. There are SO many resources on campus, academic and otherwise, so don't be afraid to reach out to someone if you're having a tough time. It's easier to fix things now than wait for them to get worse when it's super busy and hectic in the middle of next semester.

For those of you who do get dropped, it's also not the end of the world. There are so many success stories of people who take time off and return to the university or who appeal their drops or who find some way to complete their education or career goals, regardless. I understand how stressful and catastrophic things may seem, but you are still capable of improving the situation and getting things back on track. Even if it doesn't seem like it, don't forget that we all love you. Your family, your friends, we all care about you. It'll be okay, and it's definitely not worth harming yourself over.

I personally was dropped from the university after a rough few years with my mental health, and many trips to the hospital and ER, etc. I felt like I had no other options at that point, but I was very wrong, and I'm glad I pushed through. I ended up taking an almost two-year medical withdrawal to focus on my health and applied for reentry to Engineering earlier this summer and was re-accepted. I was very nervous about my first semester back, especially because I still have my probation and reentry requirements. I put a lot of effort into both my health and academics this year, and took better care of myself, and am happy to say that I'll be meeting my GPA requirement this semester. I'm also feeling way better than I've ever felt in my whole life, and am so glad I took the time off because I'm doing so much better emotionally, mentally, socially, really in every other way. I'm currently on track to graduate in 2021 and I'm so glad I'm alive. 

So please, don't freak out. If you need someone to talk to about probation, getting dropped, medical withdrawals/reentry, therapy, school, whatever, feel free to DM me. :) But please, remember, nothing is every worth ending your life or hurting yourself over.

I lost my job in the summer. My parent also lost their job that summer. They have not been able to find a job since. They will lose the house soon.\n\nThe transition to university was very difficult for me. I had no insurance for medication or therapy until school started in August. I was diagnosed for a while as having depression and anxiety by doctors. The pandemic has made it a lot worse. Here I have felt as if I am imprisoned and have no escape. The dorms feel imposingly small to me, like cells. I am surrounded by strangers, and away from the people I love and worry about. All my classes are online, so it is as if everyone I meet is part of a video game. It is highly impersonal.\n\nI was referred to ODOS for missing 2 consecutive tests. At that time frame, unfortunately I was testing once a week, which only graduate students and staff are allowed to do. (So basically the people writing you up) That same week, I took one test and was informed that they lost my test and I should retake it.“If you provided a sample at the testing site, we are writing to inform you that unfortunately, an error occurred in either the delivery, receipt or processing if your specimen.” I made other attempts to test but they were feeble. During the week I was cited, I was getting food once a day. Sometimes, I would bring food up to my room and it would sit out and I would just throw it away. I also had trouble concentrating on details. I would use my cafe credits to buy water bottles by the cafeteria, because I had trouble getting myself to go to wash my face and brush my teeth, if I was able to get myself to do those things. I would use the water bottles and stand over the trash can.\n\nDuring my initial meeting with the staff they were very mechanistic with me. I was explaining how I was depressed and they said “So, what’s the rule.” At another point I was bluntly asked “Do you have any proof of your assertions?”\n\nMy psychiatrist wrote an explanatory letter to the disciplinary staff. They wrote that “I have been treating STUDENT for depression and anxiety at PLACE. Due to financial problems, STUDENT was off of medications at the beginning of the semester. We have been working to improve PRONOUN anxiety and depression through medications, but this is often a slow process, each medication trial may take several weeks or 1-2 months. NAME still struggles with fatigue, low energy, and motivation as a symptom of PRONOUN depression. This has made it difficult for PRONOUN to keep up with certain daily activities, including going out to get COVID testing twice weekly. I support NAME request for leniency and consideration in removing NAME probationary status due to missing some COVID testing.“\n\nCovid testing is a 40 minute trip for me. I was lucky if I could even find clothes that looked clean enough and take the elevator to the cafeteria.\n\nAll the sanctions were upheld, that is to say the university sees no difference between me and someone who had a party. May as well be hung for a lamb as for a sheep. I was told that “there is no excusable deviation.” Now, make no mistake. It is important everyone tests. But the way the university went about my case is wrong. I can understand giving me the testing mandate. But giving me a record and putting me in conduct probation is going to hurt my ability to get into a good grad school and get a job. What do I tell them? That I was some dumb kid who didn’t believe in COVID but knows better or that I am actually certifiably nuts? That right there kills your chance of getting an education, psychology etc. job or graduate program.\n\nWhen I got that disciplinary decision back after my appeal, I thought my life was over. I had to call my parent to get them to talk me down because I couldn’t think straight.\n\nI just wish OSCR would have worked with me to help rehabilitate me or find a behavioral solution instead of throwing the book at me for purely punitive purposes.\n\nNow the only thing keeping me going is fear and frustration. I have to get my bachelors degree so I can get a job right away and help my family. If I do grad school while I work I either fail or I don’t. And I won’t go to the school for help no matter what happens. I am also not going to participate in any activities or talk to people in real life even if everyone is vaccinated because if someone does something stupid I get kicked out if I get sent to ODOS. Which also means now more than ever, if I see something I sure as hell ain’t saying something. I don’t have time for trouble.\n\nMeanwhile if you spit into a tube, the university will let you go to the bar or they will advertise sports games and concerts and mass events using mass mail.\n\nInb4 someone from OSCR doxxes me to throw shade or gives me a visit out of a newfound “concern for my mental health.” Don’t @ me.\n\nBro if you are homeless just buy a house.

[Concerns about an Illinois Bioengineering lab](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G_0nzq5viS6pDTm6BiyRLoXdEbpvMCh-/view)

Administrations tend to favor professors over powerless grad students, thus I chose to make it neither private or contained. For two reasons: 1. More pressure on those who have power to take action. 2. More awareness, as I am far from alone in these experiences. In fact, since I shared my experiences lately on LinkedIn, besides the overwhelming support, was too many people sharing similarly shitty experiences in grad school. The system needs to change.

The College of Engineering has responded with ""we take such concerns very seriously, and will get in touch"". Let's see what they can/are willing to do.

About my goals: It's not about the professor. I've cared about him enough during those 18 months of my life. It's about the students. Here are my goals:

1. Stop that particular lab from ruining people's careers, research passions, and mental health.
2. Inspire systematic changes of the academia system. Right now advisors has immense power over their students, but there's about no scrutiny for that power. That's based on the assumption that professors are all respectable conscientious scientists (most are, including most that I've encountered, but not all), even though little consideration was given to good character during their promotion path, -- all consideration is given to their ability to make papers. We need scrutiny, and accessible channels for students to seek help.
3. Bring awareness to young students. When you seek a grad school or postdoc lab, don't just focus on the research. Pay attention to how they treat the humans in the lab. Are they interested in helping you develop? Do they care about the human beings? You will have many opportunities to develop if they do; if it’s “Nature paper at all costs” though, consider whether you may be the cost. 

Please feel free to share widely. I did not plan to become famous for this. My direction is toward contributing to human living sustainability. But, I stumbled on a roadblock, and I'd like to remove it for the younger ones on the same journey. As much as I can. As much as we can, if you are on board.

I\'m sorry that this happened to you—but happy that you were able to successfully complete your degree.\n\n> The system needs to change.\n\nThis is true. But how? Currently all the incentives in academia are pointed in the wrong direction. Faculty who can ""inspire""—more likely, scare—their students into working insane hours are the ones who get tenure, grants, awards, and recognition. The students that decide not to submit themselves to this kind of treatment just vanish, to be replaced by others. Ones that do manage to stick around internalize these expectation, and then go on to haze the next generation once they have their own students, continuing the cycle.\n\nFrankly, reading your documents, I\'m concerned with the amount of work you yourself seem to consider acceptable. 60 hour weeks? 996? Really? This is healthy? No time for rest, exercise, amusement, love, music, food, reading, and whatever else? The problem is that, anyone who goes through that and ""succeeds"", is more likely to expect the same level of unhealthy ""dedication"" from their own students. Even once it\'s no longer strictly necessary. The PI you describe has a tenured position at a great university! And yet, he\'s still driving people that hard. Something is wrong.\n\nI had the distinct misfortune of watching my own Ph.D. adviser go through the transformation from an engaging fun human being who was accessible, relaxed, and curious (Y1) to a tenure-driven tyrant who regularly verbally abused students and even had one faint in his office from stress (Y6). But he got tenure. I decided to not treat my students that way. I didn\'t get tenure. Unfortunately, the system does reward this kind of behavior.\n\nOne idea to support change would be for tenure and promotion committees to collect confidential feedback from students about their faculty advisers. But that\'s tough to do without retaliation. And, usually colleagues also know what\'s going on, but have chosen to look the other way.\n\nThanks for speaking out. That\'s a start. But cultural change is hard. I visited a faculty member friend in Copenhagen years ago. I was struck by the fact that, at 4PM sharp, everyone left for home.

My 1st lab is a prominent one that continues to develop both breakthrough innovations and aspiring talents. I decided to leave the lab after 1 year due to some young idealism in what scientific area I wanted to work on (I\'ll explain a bit more in the next post).\n\nThe 2nd lab was working on topics that I was very interested in, but my experience there turned from exciting to traumatic. When it became clear that the research itself could not be conducted reasonably under the careless supervision even if I could endure the psychological abuse, I decided to leave. Switching labs once is normal for a lowly grad student; switching twice would be abnormal, meaning, the student is probably abnormal. I was planning for the worst. Fortunately some important friends helped me see a path forward, so I carried on.\n\n\\---\n\nI was looking for opportunities outside the US when Dr. Paul Jensen heard I was planning to leave. He invited me to his lab, saying, \'while you are applying elsewhere, why not work in my lab during your transition time. I\'ll pay you.\' So I joined the Jensen lab in 2019 as a lab technician, working on a project that Paul described as high-risk-high-reward, too hopeless that he would never give to a PhD student who needs to graduate. Later Paul persuaded me to stay for my PhD. Already knowing how much he cares about students\' development, it wasn\'t hard for me to say yes.\n\nThree years after, I successfully defended my PhD thesis in the past February. We cracked the decades-long challenge that we started with (with vital contribution from my friend and colleague Ryan Wyllie), and later dissected a series of biological networks and proposed a mechanism conducive for generating network topology diversity. My thesis was dedicated to Paul. Some words from the acknowledgment:\n\n..Beyond research itself, Paul also saved my research career. I came from the darkest phase of my life, where I developed fear for the advisor role, and wondered how much of my great passion for research was left. Paul raised me up... Now three years later, I feel strong as a researcher, with more solid grounding than ever before. For the next step I am back to my field of choice, sustainable bioproduction, and find my passion for it is as strong as like it’s never left me. Paul made it possible. He has been and will continue to be a great role model as a researcher, mentor, leader, and human being. The mission he sets for his lab is \'To train the world’s best engineers and scientists\', and I will do my best to help him achieve that goal.\n\n(Continued on comment section:)\n\nI don\'t mind it if you also paid attention to the negative things mentioned in this post. I\'ll say more, because unnecessarily negative things are what many students are still going through:\n\nI was only one of 5 (out of 8) students/postdocs who prematurely left the second lab within just that one year period, and unfortunately the only student who\'s still doing research. One told me his mental health was ""in shambles"" when he was leaving the lab months after me. He started off being one of the most passionate about research that I\'ve seen. After over 10 years as a research group, the lab page doesn\'t have an alumni section, likely because way more research careers have been ruined through his lab than developed. In fact, he seemed more invested in limiting his students than developing them. I’ll save the details but say that he manages with fear and distrust; when he also rules students’ time essentially 24/7, darkness is what students live in.\n\nWriting about that traumatic experience doesn’t do me much good. It may in fact cost me. But I won’t be me if personal cost and benefit is all I care about. It’s not about that lab head either. It’s about the young researchers who start with great expectations...

115,sotba9,Tired_Professor,457.0,0.98,20,UIUC,"Contrary to popular belief, the overwhelming abundance of research tells us that *asking* someone if they are thinking about suicide will not make them more suicidal. The opposite is true - the person may feel a sense of relief in just being able to talk openly about their mental health, life circumstances, and thoughts of suicide. If you think someone wants to end their life, please reach out to them and just ask if they are thinking about ending their life.

If someone you know has recently had a noticeable change in behaviors (becoming more erratic, looking disheveled, becoming more secretive or closed off, becoming more irritable) they may be experiencing problems with their mental health. Reach out with neutral non-judgmental observations: Hey, I noticed you’ve been on edge lately, like when you… (example XYZ). How are you doing? Is something going on?

If the person is open to talking more ask open ended questions (not yes/no questions), like: How have you been doing? How are you coping with stress? Tell me more about what’s been going on in your life. How are your classes? How are things at home?

*Normalize* mental health struggles and thoughts of suicide - they are common, especially among college students. MOST college students experience periods of anxiety and depression. Not talking about these things creates more stigma.

It can be hard, but try not to *generalize* or *minimize* what the person is going through. It can be painful to have someone make assumptions about your experiences when they make sweeping generalizations or when they try to make you feel better by saying it’s no big deal. We can normalize these experiences without minimizing them or making assumptions about what peoples’ lived experiences have been like.

*Ask* if the person is open to learning more about resources or help. This shows you care about them but respect their autonomy. If they are open to it, help facilitate a connection: walk them to the counseling center, help make a phone call to the counseling center together, help them make a connection to resources that might be a source of their stress (e.g., financial aid office, tutoring, a grief and loss group).

Listen. Sometimes people just need someone to hear them out. Reflect back what they are saying: So it sounds like your classes have really been stressing you out. What I’m hearing you say is that finances are a major source of stress for you. 

While helpful, national crisis lines are a last resort. Making a human connection with someone you know who is struggling can make a more immediate impact *before* a crisis situation, like a suicide attempt, occurs. If someone is in *crisis*, call 911 and tell the dispatcher it is a mental health emergency so that appropriate first responders are sent (e.g., a trained crisis intervention team, not a traffic cop).

If you are a student and experiencing mental health problems or are thinking of suicide, you can reach out to your professors. We will help you connect with resources, and we can lessen the stress induced by artificial deadlines and unnecessary course requirements.

Reach out if you think someone is thinking about suicide. You might save their life.","[{'author': 'Tired_Professor', 'body': 'I can see that there are a lot of folks in this thread right now.

125,86nzbe,Swyft135,522.0,0.94,27,UIUC,"One of my most vivid childhood memories was riding on a train. I still remember that particular trip. Boarding, finding the sleeping space I’d share with my mother, my heart pumping with excitement as the throttle of the engine began. The steel walls of our cabin shook. Slowly but surely, we left the light of the train station and then there was nothing to see in the outdoor darkness, except for the moon, surrounded by a halo of softly lit clouds. The rocking of the train lulled me to sleep that night. In the morning, the same, rhythmic rocking woke me. The city I knew was gone by then; outside was nothing except borderless grasslands. That moment, I felt that I belonged – in the train, to no geographical location in particular, but to everywhere. Since then, I have dreamed of becoming an engineer. I want to be the one driving the train, and bringing smiles to peoples’ faces, just like the engineer of that train did for me.


Fast forward 12 years. I was accepted into UIUC’s acclaimed ECE program. I was overjoyed. There was something nostalgic about mechanical engineering, the organic throttling of the steam engine. But I knew society was ready to move on to sleek bullet-noses and sterile electric motors and automated announcers’ voices. Society wanted Electric and Computer Engineers.


During my first semesters at UIUC, I didn’t really get to take courses in ECE. Most of my classes were just basics, like physics and math. The only mention of engineering during my first year came during a CS lecture, where the professor used train cabins to explain doubly linked lists. My second year, I learned about circuits and electromagnetics, no doubt important topics, especially with the rising popularity of mag-lev technology. Some course subjects were very difficult for me to grasp, but in the end, through grit, I managed to maintain a 3.6 GPA.


It was not until fall semester senior year when I realized something seemed off. It was in my Quantum Electronics class. The class barely had anything to do with engineering, even moreso than my previous classes. I was almost done with college at this point, yet had never even set foot in a train. None of my classes directly mentioned them. I went to the counselor’s office in ECEB, and talked about how much I appreciated the classes building up my fundamentals, but disliked never getting to the actual meat of engineering. The counselor (forgot her name) told me that UIUC’s ECE program didn’t cover actual train-driving. She told me that ""engineering"" didn't mean the same thing as ""driving trains"". She said it without shame.


Inside, I broke. I walked briskly out of the counselor’s office, tears streaming down my face. I did not pour my energy and time into this program for the past three years to hear something like that. I headed back to my apartment, sank into bed, and slept. Because I didn’t know what else I could do.


It took a long time for me to recover emotionally. I think I’m in a slightly better place now. I’ve applied to a graduate Electrical Engineering program elsewhere, and will be joining a group researching high-speed bus architectures. I can’t quite understand their publications yet, and I’m still mostly interested in trains, but working with busses will be closer to train-driving than anything UIUC had to offer me.


For anyone else in the UIUC ECE program who’s had their dreams dashed like me, I send you my deepest sympathies.

During my 2 years at UIUC you could find me at every office hour for every teacher and TA I could find time for. Every extra credit opportunity I made sure I did.

For those who want to know details of what happened I decided to leave specifics out because that’s not the purpose of my post. The purpose of my post was to bring light to the issue using my own experience. 

I will say, the hazing was a wide spectrum. Forced alcohol consumption, physical abuse, verbal abuse, mental abuse, and egregious sleep deprivation.

I am instead requesting you to not be a slob. I understand that sometimes you are in a hurry or that you don’t understand we’re a dining hall and not a buffet. 

However, I ask that you:

1. Please don’t put your napkins in your cups or leave them on your plates.

In the dish room, Regardless of what you did with the napkins, I still have to touch them with my bare hands and throw them out because you didn’t.  This is not only disgusting when coupled with all the other stuff you put on your plate, but time consuming and allows dishes to pile up since the flow of dishwashing is broken. When there are hundreds or thousands of dishes every hour, this is quite problematic.

There is usually a garbage can in front of the conveyer belt. Please use it, it takes less than 20 seconds. At the very least separate them from your plates and cups.

2. Please put your silverware in the bins under the conveyer belt.

Again, this is disgusting and time consuming. This is disappointing and mildly agitating since the silverware bins are physically in front of you when you put your dishes on the belt. The garbage can isn’t consistently there across dining halls for whatever reason but these bins are always right in front of your face. Please take 5 seconds to remove your silverware from them.

3. If there is food on your plate please place it in the renewable garbage bins. (When they’re out)

These are usually right next to the silverware bins during dinner. Again, the food mixes with the napkins and silverware making it incredibly disheartening to want to clean and difficult to separate everything.

A lot of times there are 3 or more different types of dishes with food and napkins on them stacked on top of one another. This is way more disgusting than it sounds. Please clean your plates of excess waste before placing on the conveyer if possible. 

4. If your bowl or cup is full of liquid please don’t place it on the top conveyer.

The amount of times I have spilled milk ,mixed drinks, and broth is immeasurable. I have to sit with that nasty stuff on my clothes for the whole shift.

We are usually understaffed, but even when we aren’t, we are human beings and I’d appreciate being treated like one.

136,esouvt,RA_throwaway_fckoff,733.0,0.94,96,UIUC,"Hey guys, it's your friendly neighborhood RA here. I know the rules say no throwaways, but Mods, hear me out. I'm posting on a throwaway so I don't lose my job. But I think this is important for everyone to read. I have been loyally employed to University Housing since my Sophomore year of college, and every single semester, they find a new way to piss me off. But this semester, they really went above and beyond. I'm writing this, not only because I'm pissed off, but because I feel as though the other students of this University should know what is going on in the background. Because they're not just wasting my money, they're wasting yours too. So let's begin with last Friday.

Last Friday, all of the RA's and MA's were required to come back a full day earlier from our Winter Break so that we could attend a ""training"" on anti-Semitism. For those of you who don't remember, last semester there was a major controversy in which an MA made a presentation that was horribly misconstrued as anti-Semitic, and for some reason, Robert J. Jones, our Lord and Savior, decided he needed to take action on this matter which he was incredibly misinformed about. So he hired two presenters from the Jewish United Fund of Metropolitan Chicago to come speak to us. However, had he taken the time to vet his sources, or at least perform a very simple Google search, he would know that this particular group has in the past few years been at the center of some major protests, mostly by other Jewish people who are not in support of the JUF's tendency to donate and fund anti-Islam and anti-Arabic hate groups. In fact, if our illustrious leader, Chancellor Robert J. Jones takes some time away from his busy schedule of writing massmails to read this, I've found a link right [here, found from said simple Google search.](https://chicagomonitor.com/2017/03/chicago-jewish-activists-tell-jewish-united-fund-stop-funding-anti-muslim-hate-groups/) Why did Jones hire someone that so obviously goes against the message of tolerance, acceptance, and social justice that we strive to promote? My guess would be laziness.

The presenters came and gave less of a training, and more of a biased lecture, in which we were certainly educated on the problem of anti-Semitism, but we were also bombarded with definitions and explanations that were so obviously biased, it was ridiculous. Any students with dissenting opinions were silenced and ignored. When asked about Palestinian's culture and beliefs, specifically regarding self-determination, the presenters appropriately stated that they were not of that culture, and had no authority to speak on it. But though he should, I doubt our fearless leader, Chancellor Jones is going to call in anyone to represent the students of Palestinian identity. So I guess to him, they just don't matter. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, Jonesy. I'm just stating how it looks.

Then comes Saturday. Normally, this day of training would be reserved for in-hall time, in which we would be able to work with our staff on building-specific topics and have time to work on our bulletin boards and floor decorations. Instead, Housing decided that this semester, they would revoke our usual in-hall time and replace it with a 7 hour training, in which we sat in the same room of the SDRP, in the same seats, while listening to the same two people give us a lecture on self care from 9am to 4:30pm. They wasted 2 of those hours talking about the exact same social-identity spiel that I've heard at least 3 times per semester, every semester. Towards the end of the training, one of the presenters talked about how she understood that our jobs are hard, and being an RA is difficult, and stressful. And that she knows that we don't get paid enough for what we do, we don't get compensated enough for the time and effort we put into this job. This was met with thunderous applause from all of the RA's and MA's in the room, only for it to fall flat when the same presenter suggested that an appropriate remedy to this issue is making sure that we self-care more. That night, having been deprived of our usual time to work on things, myself and most of the other RA's in my building were up until 2 am working on bulletin boards and floor decorations before the school year had even started.

I think my main complaint here is that the University as a whole is so incredibly blind to the needs of it's students, and deaf to their complaints. Do you know why we got a 7 hour training on self care? It wasn't for us. We were taught less about how to self care for ourselves, and more how to help others find self care strategies. It was so we could teach it to our residents, and so we knew how to help our residents work on it because mental health is such a wide-spread problem, not just in University Housing, but on the campus as a whole. Mental health is something that not only I struggle with, but so do my friends, my coworkers, my residents, my coworker's residents, my classmates, etc. And it's not as easy as just going to the Counseling Center. I don't know how many of you have tried lately to get regular support from the campus counseling center, but let me tell you, its damn near impossible. The Counseling Center is **OVERRUN** with students *all the time*. You would think that this would be a signal to the University that maybe they need to focus more on the mental health needs of their students. But instead, they ignore it and put it on their housing staff to solve the problem. While some students are slaving away, working two jobs just to be able to afford to go here while scraping by in their classes, the University decides to hike up the tuition rate. The Counseling Center is ALWAYS full and counselors are always in demand. Yet, instead of hiring more licensed professionals to help take care of the depressed, anxious, and in some cases, suicidal students, they give Tim Killeen a $100,000 bonus for doing such a good job writing the Massmails. Mental health is such an important issue, and we have students in the residence halls *every single year* attempt to take their own lives. I've seen a few cases just this last semester. And it kills me every time, because no one deserves to feel ignored. No one deserves to feel forgotten. But I feel like the mental health needs of the students on this campus HAVE been forgotten.

Today during our weekly staff meeting, we talked about all of the complaints we had and improvements we think needed to be made on the training this year. And I made the point that I feel like we are not being heard. Moreso, we are actively being ignored by Housing. The same way the students of this campus as a whole are being actively ignored by the University. They act like they care, and they preached to the RA's and MA's for 7 hour straight about self-care, all the while taking away 7 hours worth of potential self-care from the very students they lectured. They preach tolerance and social justice, and then hire the least tolerant association they could find to give us a biased speech on anti-Semitism. I don't know what the solution here is. My hopes is that this will piss someone off enough that the administration of the University will read it. That someone with power will actually listen. Or at the very least, that maybe if there's enough of us rallying for it, maybe we can make some change on this campus. Because I'm sick and tired of being ignored by the University. I'm sick and tired of the mental health needs of all of us being forgotten. I don't know what needs done, but I'm sick and tired of doing nothing.

I'm a first time TA and this semester was actually pretty difficult for me. I had a medium-sized class (about 60 students) and I had to switch from in-person to online never having taught either type of course this semester.

From 140 employees in March to only 8 employees today. With the PPP Loan money running out and business still not returning, the future of our company (and our industry) is in jeopardy. We need help! Here are the actions we have been taking to try and get our employees back on payroll and our company back on track...

We have sent multiple letter to Governor JB Pritzker asking for a small part of the $900 million that the State of Illinois has dedicated to businesses which have been “impacted by the pandemic.” We have received no response and no money. With 99.2% of Peoria Charter’s business disappearing since the Executive Order was made on March 20, we just don’t know how a business could be more “impacted” than that? 

We have been reaching out to Senator Tammy Duckworth and Senator Dick Durbin for their support on the CERTS Act, which has money specifically dedicated to the Motorcoach Industry (S.4150). If you fill out the information on this link (https://p2a.co/ONoZXmx), it will send them a letter of support for the CERTS Act. 

We have been reaching out to Rep. Darin LaHood and Rep. Cheri Bustos (and we are working on getting in contact with Rep. Rodney Davis) about the remaining amounts of money for PPP Loan being dedicated back to companies who are still going without business due to COVID-19. It seems like the current set up for the PPP loan is punishing companies (like Peoria Charter) who actually hired back employees and used the money to get their staff off of unemployment, like the money was intended to do. At the same time, it is rewarding the business owners who sat on the PPP money and had employees continue to collect unemployment, while they received an extremely low interest loan that is mostly forgivable. 

For the past few months, we have been having this battle for our business in private, but after the response we have received from our email yesterday asking for support, we feel it is time to humble ourselves and share where we are at. The only reason we have been in business this long is our loyal customers, and the only way we will continue to stay in business through 2020 is the support from people like you. If anyone out there has connections to any of these issues (or politicians) that can help support our business, and help us put pressure on these issues, we would be extremely grateful for your assistance. We are a 4th generation, family-owned company that has been providing transportation in Illinois for 79 years. We have gone from a thriving, successful business in March to an unstable, idle business desperately needing assistance and unable to find it.

If you brought workers back onto the payroll but didn't actually have them performing any actual work then that seems like it was a pretty bad business decision. I would have thought you would keep your workers on unemployment since they'd be collecting the additional $600/week from the Fed right now and you'd have a much better chance of recovering from this if you waited to bring them back until the start of the next school semester. I haven't seen anything written that the PPP loan was intended for businesses to bring back unproductive employees and just pay them to do nothing. My impression was that it was always meant to help a business get through this struggle in whatever way was going to best enable the business to survive so that they could provide their workers long term stability. Again, if your bus drivers and admin staff were on unemployment just run the numbers quickly - it's likely that they were collecting a good portion of their normal pay from unemployment benefits so there was very little reason to bring them back onto the payroll if you didn't have any profitable work for them to be performing."", 'score': -35, 'created_utc': 1594826670.0}]","{'neg': 0.053, 'neu': 0.828, 'pos': 0.119, 'compound': 0.9891}",0.119,0.053,0.9891

150,a8e4hr,None,537.0,0.97,53,UIUC," CorruptCU.com - How the Police, Bar Owners, Jailers, Prosecutors, Public Defendants, and Local Media Conspired to Protect a Well Connected Individual Who Drunkenly Accused an Innocent Man of Snatching Her Purse After She Misplaced It, And Nearly Ruined His Life   


Yesterday, near the end of the last week before Christmas, a post shot to the top of the most popular Champaign-Urbana, Illinois local Subreddit, r/UIUC. The post links to CorruptCU.com, which is a long letter written by Urbana resident Chris Hansen telling the story of how he was falsely accused of snatching a purse, arrested, and mistreated in jail, and how he then discovered that bar owners, local media, and public defendants were conspiring with the police and prosecutors to suppress evidence and protect his false accuser. Soon after the Reddit post, people on Facebook started sharing a link to the website, and it has been shared hundreds of times within the first 24 hours. The 13,000 word letter goes into incredible detail with painstaking citations of proof, including dashcam footage, FOIA attained documents, press clippings, screen shots, and more. The story reports brazen misuse of power by police and jail personnel while the author was being arrested and jailed, as well as abuse of power and public trust by the police and prosecutors in the investigation and court proceedings. The police refused to do an investigation in good faith, which was tantamount to a cover up of their abuses and of the falsity of the purse snatching accusation. It also chronicles the suspicious disappearance of particular exculpatory videos from downtown bars security footage owned by friends of the accuser, and the suspicious journalistic practices that lead the News Gazette to write false stories about the incident. The letter also details the reluctance of local law firms to litigate against the well-connected accuser, who is also the daughter of a former police officer. Overall, the letter and story within paints a very detailed and clear picture of a corrupt class of bar owners, lawyers, police, and local media who wantonly abuse their power and the public’s trust to protect their own. The letter was also sent to the Attorney General, States Attorney, and several other local and state government agencies. Will these agencies hold these people accountable, or will responsibility allude the leaders of our community again?","[{'author': 'djhin2', 'body': 'Mary Schenk needs to be called out for this.

158,fmhk0h,NoFailUIUC,405.0,0.86,77,UIUC,"We find ourselves in extraordinary times and in two days are expected to go back to ordinary routines. The novel coronavirus or COVID-19 [threatens the health and lives of millions in this country](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/20/us/coronavirus-model-us-outbreak.html), as well as across the globe. With an inadequate response at the federal level, states are now rushing to handle the pandemic. Here at UIUC, *only two days before break* were we notified that classes were suspended, leaving many of us still scrambling to figure out future plans.

Students from across the country have formed the [National Intercollegiate COVID-19 Coalition](https://niccoalition.org/) in calling for their schools to pivot away from traditional grading scales, with organizers at **MIT, Columbia, and the University of Michigan** successfully petitioning for universal pass/fail. We at **No Fail UIUC** follow in the footsteps of our peers at Yale in **petitioning UIUC to switch to a universal pass grading system**, in order to mitigate the unequal impact COVID-19 will have on low income, neurodivergent, rural, international, and many other students.

Many students will inevitably contract the virus. Some students will die. **All will struggle- and to what degree will be partially determined by how the school responds.**

Our rationale is as follows:

Success in education is determined not just by individual ability, but the resources available to a student- housing, food security, internet access, physical and mental health, etc. Being on campus with university resources acts as an equalizer, but due to current events, students will return home to wildly different circumstances that will determine how well they do on schoolwork and thus impact their futures.

With [millions of workers laid off](https://www.vox.com/2020/3/21/21188529/initial-unemployment-claims-goldman-sachs), students find themselves worried about their family’s economic situation: whether they can afford schooling next year, whether they can pay rent or mortgages, or whether there’ll even be food on the table. Many students are also expected to care for siblings whose K-12 education has been suspended. Others may be caring for family members who are at grave risk during this time, or may be immunocompromised themselves. **When the lives of yourself and your loved ones are in jeopardy, academics should be the last thing you have to be concerned about.**

Those without consistent internet access are forced to venture out to libraries and other public spaces, endangering themselves and others- that is, *if* they haven’t been closed already, leaving them unable to do their coursework

Students with anxiety, depression, ADHD, and other learning disabilities find themselves set adrift without academic or social support structures, struggling with overwhelming dread or distractions by the circumstances of a global health crisis without their counselors, friends, or disability resources to help them through it.

Others return to unstable home lives- neglect or abuse, even domestic violence- and are now trapped with abusive families by social isolation and stay-in-place orders.

International students undergo unique stressors by nature of being isolated from their families here, or returning to unstable situations in their home countries. Those in different time zones find themselves unable to attend live lectures & discussions unless they exhaust themselves by working into the late hours of the night, impacting their health and educational outcomes.

Through no fault of their own, **these students will get worse grades and/or fail classes, not only harming them in future job and graduate school applications in an uncertain economy, but potentially delaying their graduations and causing extra financial strain.**

While some professors have already recognized these issues and have announced graciously flexible grading policies, they remain a minority. Even today, two days from the start of school, many have no updates from their professors on what to expect for the next half of the semester. While this is understandable, seeing as teaching staff have their own personal issues to deal with during this time, it highlights the fact that **we cannot place the expectation of equal treatment on individual professors and instead need a response at the institutional level.**

UIUC has had a long standing commitment and history of equality in education. We call upon faculty and the administration to further honor this legacy, by:

* **Switching to a Universal Pass system**
* **Refunding tuition + fees to reflect the move to an online system**
* **Subsidizing educational resources for disadvantaged students- laptops, internet access, software fees, etc.**

It\'s a lot to digest, and I feel like I\'m still figuring out how I feel about something like this, but a few related thoughts:\n\n- How do you feel about grades outside of this situation? A lot of the critiques you have in this situation apply in normal circumstances as well. (This is something I\'ve thought about a lot recently.)\n- I think there\'s a lot of merit to a universal approach here. I think trying to keep the logistics of whatever you propose as simple as possible is a very good idea.\n- I\'d be a bit nervous about suggesting students spreading this via courses\' Piazzas. I\'m generally very defensive about any advertising in my ""classroom."" I think there\'s good reason to do so here, but just be aware that this could upset some faculty. (I understand that you might not be worried about that given the situation.)\n- Please be aware that many of your instructors are already trying to do everything they can to make continuation of their courses possible for everyone. While getting them to support something like this is helpful, realize that we generally don\'t make decisions about policies like these. These sorts of policies generally come from ""the administration"" which does include input from some faculty, but most of us are just as disconnected as you are. While you fight for something like this, we\'ll continue trying our best to keep courses running.\n- If courses continue as planned, or we move to a pass-fail system, or a universal pass system, please continue to reach out to your professors if you\'re in a situation where you\'re unable to make progress in a course. While in many situations there might not be much that we can do, if there is something we can help with, we can only help if we know about it.\n- Again, I generally like the way you\'re approaching this, but I\'m a bit nervous that efforts like these will add to students stress. (You can already see some nervousness in the comments here.) There is already a lot of extra noise in our lives right now, and this is adding to it. I don\'t know if there\'s any way you can minimize that, but I think it\'s something to keep in mind.\n- I see a lot of comments related to tuition and online courses. Note that there are already some rules around tuition for online courses, up to and including situations where you pay regular tuition while taking an online course. There are also programs that are fully online (students only take online courses) and pay tuition, although sometimes at a different rate. I\'d just keep this in mind when making proposals about tuition. Maybe try to separate the tuition issue (financial hardship in these times) from the online course delivery.\n\nJust my two cents.

Got this letter in the mail today. Sorry for the crappy cell phone picture, I'll reproduce the majority of it in my response below.

[Here is a link to the letter i received](http://imgur.com/a/OYasT).

Dear Mr. Long,

First, please be advised that my e-mail address is Murph@murph.cc. You
have it wrong.

Below, I respond to each point of your email in detail. Be advised
that I'm quickly retyping your words as I go, and thus and omissions
or typographical errors are a mistake. Please supply me with a proper
electronic copy of further correspondence.

> It is my client's understanding that you are the moderator of this
  thread

I am one of several moderators, and many reddit admins who have the
ability to interact with the postings on /r/uiuc.

> and not only are you personally publishing false and libelous
  information

I don't believe I am, it'd be helpful if you could respond with the
specifics on this accusation. I don't intend to be libelous.

> but you are also allowing false and libelous posting about my
  client's business operations despite clear knowledge on your part
  that the materials are untruthful.

I have no 'clear knowledge' that anything posted is libelous, and as
far as i know, I am under no legal obligation to prevent these
postings. If you wish to have those postings modified, please address
your letters to Reddit, not myself. I believe strongly in allowing
people to post their opinions and try to only remove content if it is
violating the community guidelines.

> It is my understanding that you have no personal experience to form
  as a basis to make the assertions that you have published, because
  you have never been a customer of Suburban Express with a negative
  experience.

This is false. I've had personal negative experiences with Suburban
Expresss, both as a customer and not.

> It is my understanding that whenever anyone attempts to post
  something that either defends or makes positive reference to
  Suburban Express, you take the extraordinary step of removing that
  information.

Actually, there are many positive postings that have not been
removed. I have even used my moderation ability to whitelist positive
postings by frequent members of the community. I have only removed
postings that were either spam (Such as someone creating multiple
accounts), violating the community guidelines (Posting personal
information, harassing, etc), or otherwise unsuitable for the content
of the subreddit, /r/uiuc. I do not claim to be perfect, though, and
determining which posts are made by legitimate users is not something
I can do with 100% accuracy.

> This exercise of control over the reddit postings by you are clearly
  done for no other purpose than to harm the business interest of my
  client.

The primary goal of my posting and action is to further the discussion
and community of /r/uiuc. I also aim to prevent the many readers and
students who get their information from /r/uiuc from being targeted by
lawsuits. 

> You further claim to know that some and/or all of the posts which
  are negative about Suburban Express are being made by someone at
  Suburban Express, however, I doubt that you have any actual proof of
  your thoughts.

I will assume that you meant 'postive' instead of 'negative' since
surely SubEx wouldn't be insulting itself.

I don't have any proof. However, I have a strong personal belief and
many of the users agree with me. There probably is such proof,
however, which would only come to light if this proceeds to litigation
- a counter-claim of harassment would reveal the IP logs during
discovery. You can ask your client if that would be a good thing, or a
bad thing, for him.

> The fact that you are taking these actions to remove anything which
  might counterbalance the negativity expressed against Suburban
  Express evidences your intent to maintain this reddit thread to
  interfere with and harm the business interests of Suburban Express.

As discussed, that is not what I'm doing. So no, It doesn't. That is
not my intent.

> My client also takes issue with a heading on your thread where you
  inform people ""don't ride Suburban Express! They are likely to sue
  you, have terrible reviews, and also this"". Based upon the ridership
  of Suburban Express though this year and the year of 2012, the
  percentage of customers who are sued for violating the terms and
  conditions is so minuscule as to make your claims about being sued
  false, and this fact is also true relative to your claim about
  terrible reviews.

Peoria Charter has sued none of it's passengers. I don't know of any
other local bus company that has. Over a hundred lawsuits,
comparatively, is thus very likely.

If you're trying to argue that 1.5/5 stars is not ""terrible reviews""
than you need to visit internet review sites more often. That is
clearly bad.

I stand by these claims, and they will remain up until I see a serious
change in the behavior of your client and receive a public apology for
his actions.

> Accordingly, if you do not take corrective action to remedy the
  damages from your false and libelous postings by removing the items
  at issue by April 27, 2013, Suburban Express has authorized the
  pursuit of legal actions against you as a result of your conduct.

Again, I'm not sure exactly which 'postings' you consider
libelous. Please be specific in the future so we can discuss the
individual assertions within them.

As far as I can see, your client has no legal ground to stand on, is
probably guilty of harassment, and should be ashamed of his actions.

I welcome your response. I'd also encourage you to make an account on
Reddit if you do not already have one, and to visit the UIUC
subreddit. You could even do a ""AMA"" style posting (short for Ask Me
Anything) - I'm sure many of our community members would love to ask
questions about what it's like to be a lawyer and what it's like to
represent Suburban Express.

Valediction,

https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2020/10/26/jewish-students-university-illinois-allege-anti-semitic-environment

See, that doesn't track right with me. Look, swastikas have been thrown up in different places, and that's shit. But the administration has taken reasonable steps against that. What these students are complaining about is political action against Israel. Political action that I support.

There's a friend of mine from High School who is, without a doubt, in the top five for smartest people I've ever met based on the raw speed at which her brain worked. She's Jewish, very Jewish, and in fact is doing her undergrad in Judaic studies. Did a Birthright trip. I got into a discussion with her about American support for Israel, and she basically said that I must have been brainwashed by anti-Semitic propaganda in order to disagree with Israel. And that made me sad, because here is this brilliant young woman, liberal as can be, claiming that everything anti-Israeli must be fake news or is offset by how Israel sometimes does free heart surgeries for Palestinians or something.

I am a Jew, like my father and my mother before me. I was made Bar Mitzvah next to the Western Wall, in Israel, wearing my grandfather's tallis. I keep my dairy from my meat, I do not eat pork, and I have a tendency to make remarks in Yiddish. I am related by both blood and marriage to survivors of the Holocaust, who I have met, and spoken to about their experience. And, furthermore, I believe that Israel, as a state, should exist.

But... this shit that's going on now, it's wrong. There is an international power with major influence in the Levant that is using its superior military and economic backing to fuck over the native population and drive them from their homes, all the while justifying the actions to themselves in the name of self defense and domestic security. That was what the *Romans* did to *us*, two thousand years ago, and we were bitter about it that entire time. But suddenly we get our own country, fresh from the horrors that can be inflicted when major powers wish to bully those with less influence, and within a hundred years we're doing to same to the Palestinians?

I am a Jew, like my father and mother before me. And that means that, as a Jew, it befits me not to simply go along with what people tell me I should be, but rather to try and fashion myself in the style of the Jews that make me proud to be Jewish. And none of those are Benjamin Netanyahu. They are people like Abraham Heschel, who marched with MLK, and Moishe ben Maimon, who would continue working on Shabbos if it meant he could treat more patients in his role as a physician, regardless of their religion or status.

So when these students want to wholly conflate anti-Israeli political sentiments with anti-Semitism, what they're really saying is ""If you're not rabidly in support of a country that engages in the indefensible, you're not really a Jew."" It's underhanded. And it's fuckery of a high order. So I say fuck 'em, any Jew that would rather support Israel's actions than give some sympathy to the Palestinians has never really gotten what they should've out of Pesach, and from Purim. 

I do not believe in any way that the University of Illinois is especially anti-Semitic, given their track record of effectively and quickly denouncing and taking actions against legitimate anti-Semitic events that have occurred, and believe that a Senate resolution promoting a boycott of Israeli products is not only non anti-Semitic, but is basically wholly decent.

170,na4t53,MaintenanceOk5194,732.0,0.99,75,UIUC,"I'm making this post to help any uiuc students who are maybe thinking about signing at the retreat on Lincoln ave- or for students who are currently living here and renewed for next year. And tbh, I know that a lot of landlords do not respect student rights, so please hear me out!!! Sorry if this is long- I just want to make sure I get across to other people that this is not a good place for students.

What Happened: Last week, the maintenance person at the retreat walked into my bedroom while I was asleep and woke me up to ask me questions about my apartment. I was not dressed, and I was trying to sleep in bc it was reading day. Keep in mind that this is a man I don't know, standing in a 23 yr old girls bedroom while she is not dressed. I told him that he shouldn't be in my apartment, and definitely not in my bedroom, because I did not receive a 24 hour notice... and also bc why would anyone enter someone else's home and wake them up???? However, he stayed in my apartment for another few minutes despite me being suuuuuper uncomfortable. This is the 3rd time this maintenance person has walked into my apartment for 'inspections' without a notice while I was asleep. In Urbana, entry without a 24 hr notice is illegal unless for emergencies.. When I told one of the managers (Logan) what happened, they instead started trying to shift the blame on me by mentioning that my boyfriend sometimes sleeps at my place (which has nothing to do with any of this). They refused to take blame and instead threatened me. I called the police, who told me that contacting the student legal services was a better option.

This is where the legality of their contract comes in... I contacted the student legal services and showed them the lease which states that the staff at the retreat can enter an apartment of a resident **whenever they want**, **without a notice**. The attorney confirmed that this is ILLEGAL and therefore, the maintenance person should have been arrested for his actions. Specifically, the illegal contract states:

""Landlord (and its agents, employees, contractors, representatives, and service providers) shall have the right to enter the Bedroom and Unit at all reasonable hours (or, in the event of an emergency, at any time), without notice to Resident and without Resident’s consent-""

The law always trumps a contract. By entering my apartment freely and without my consent puts me and my privacy at risk... and honestly it puts the maintenance person at risk as well... What if I thought he was a home invader and I tried to protect myself with a weapon???

Please do not sign a lease with the retreat until they fix this illegal clause. They do not respect students and they do not respect laws on our privacy. And if you currently live here, write an email to the Urbana mayor, Diane Marlin ([dwmarlin@urbanaillinois.us](mailto:dwmarlin@urbanaillinois.us)) and copy her on the lease.

[Yeah, I see my thumb. But I had a catheter in me, so I will not be blamed for this.](https://preview.redd.it/vx8u10ujbde71.jpg?width=850&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a927e9d622f7c38be051f8e4d7b5c8d069c4b284)

Hi! My name is Megan. This picture is of me several years ago in the hospital a day after a heart surgeon had pulled a tumor the size of a stick of butter out of my chest. It had been wrapping itself around my airway at the time – I went in thinking I had walking pneumonia and came out with a cancer diagnosis. It sucked, but I lived. But it also took 7 months of aggressive chemo to make sure. I lost my hair, I felt like crap some days, but again, I lived so it all worked out. I was 37 at the time.

Today, I work at Grainger library. And I’m here to do two things. Put a human face on someone at risk, and make a request. I’m asking that you wear masks. Yes, even if you’re vaccinated.

I know, it sucks. It also sucks for me – believe me, I have the perspective of someone who had to carry around a liter of chemo liquid as it continuously pumped fluid so noxious into my veins that they had to use a chest port to get it there lest it dissolve my flesh. So yeah, masks do suck – I’m with ya. But even though I’m vaccinated, the idea of being one of the breakthrough cases and dying on a ventilator sucks even more. I didn’t survive cancer to die of a souped-up flu.

We’ve been here all year – the staff at Grainger. We were here even before the vaccine was released. And if you’re thinking, “sure, you’re paid to be there,” yeah, but check the salaries for library civil service sometime. While I know I’m lucky to make what I make (I know there are folks way worse off than me) I’m also not sipping mimosas poolside after work. I make enough to have both a Playstation AND an Xbox. I didn’t have to choose. 😉 But I’m not doing this work because I make the big bucks. I’m doing it because I’ve always loved working in libraries. I’ve been doing it since I was an undergrad. I knew I wasn’t going to be a researcher curing cancer, or an engineer figuring out how to make earthquake proof buildings – but I was good at finding stuff for people, and maybe I could help someone find the information they needed to cure cancer or make earthquake proof buildings.

And that philosophy is why the head of the Grainger Engineering library wanted us to try really hard to make sure we remained open, even during the worst of it. We wanted you to have as much of that college experience as possible and we wanted to support you in your work.

I know there are some of you who think this will ruin your college experience – but trust me, I also have perspective on that. My parents couldn’t afford to house me in a dorm. So I lived with them my first two years at college. No one wanted to come to my place to hang out. I was isolated and unable to connect to almost anyone. By the time I was a junior and could afford my own place, everyone had grouped up. College wasn’t the same for me as it was for everyone on campus. I made exactly one college friend. I don’t have any fond memories of college other than some of the professors I was able to get classes with. I’m not trying to whine. I’m fine. I’m not unhappy with my life. But I know, right now, today, there are students out there in similar situations – due to finances or physical limitations – who are absolutely not ever going to get the chances you have -mask or no. They are unhappy, and wish a mask was the only thing holding them back from having the time of their life. Not even my graduate school experience was untainted – I still remember the vibe of coming to work at ACES one day to see everyone staring at their computer monitors watching CNN that fateful day in September. But we all got through that, too. We carried on and coped in our own ways.

Even so, I feel for each and every one of you who has to go through this. I too was excited when the mask mandate ended. I supervise 10 graduate assistants, some of whom will never know what UIUC campus life is like since they were so bummed over the last year, they finished the degree in a year and a summer to get it over with. I am absolutely in pain on their behalf. I hate this is what they got. College is expensive, a huge time investment and a lot of emotions are tied up into the promise of what the experience could be. I. Get. It. But I’m still asking you to mask up because it’s not safe yet.

And maybe you still don’t care – you’re not in a high-risk group. Sure. But that doesn’t mean you can’t get it and spread it. And every person on this campus that you come into contact with now has to take that particular risk with you, only their odds aren’t as good. All these people are here to support your college experience while you get to have it have little say in the matter if you refuse to mask up. We have to work to earn a paycheck and pay bills, rent, put food on the table, etc. The head of this library is in his 70s. There are more than a few folks who work here with co-morbidities. We’ve all been vaccinated. But breakthrough cases happen ([https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/breakthrough-covid-infections-show-the-unvaccinated-are-now-putting-the-vaccinated-at-risk](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/breakthrough-covid-infections-show-the-unvaccinated-are-now-putting-the-vaccinated-at-risk)) – and they are more likely to happen the more you’re exposed.

Delta is scary. We’re filled with anxiety, our blood pressure is up, our mental fatigue is high, and we don’t have the option of being 20 anymore. But we’re still here. We’ve kept at it all through the last year, and we’ll keep at it again this year. And all we’re asking you to do to help us out is wear a mask. Maybe I’m biased, but I like not dying of Covid. I like not risking even a terrible, horrible, no good flu. I like being safe. If wearing a piece of cloth on my face is the price I have to pay not to have Covid wreck my life, or the lives of those I work with, I’ll do it.

Finally, please don’t direct your anger at those asking you to mask up. The maskers are probably all vaccinated - we're just scared people. We’re having to mask up again because some folks have been fooled into thinking a virus votes and has political reasoning. And those folks are keeping this thing going and making it worse, changing Covid as it multiplies and mutates in their bodies so that our protection becomes less effective with each iteration. Saying the masks will never end, and this is just one long step in forever is missing the point. If everyone got vaccinated, or if even enough of us did, we’d be back on track to de-mask. Help educate yourself and others so they make safe choices. That's truly the only way we'll beat this bastard Covid. I looked some stuff up for you. Because that’s one of the things I do.

**Edit:**  
Thanks for pointing out I forgot some links on how masks help prevent the spread of infection! For those unfamiliar with hospitals, health professionals will mask up to help keep the patients from getting sick, but there's also new evidence that masks also help the wearer, too. The prime reasons for masking, however, is to keep your breath from causing harm to others, thus the reason it's important to mask for the sake of others.

As students here, you get access to Science Direct - in fact you have access to many scientific journals that would normally be priced too high for most to pay for. I encourage everyone to try some searches from the library's webpage about these topics if they're curious. Some searches can be trickier than others, but merely using Mask effectiveness and Covid as search terms will bring you an abundance of research to look into. Try it!

181,lmajmi,Ivor_Chen,1537.0,0.98,87,UIUC,"To my fellow graduate researchers, professors, undergraduate students,

First of all, I want to thank all the students for their incredible support in the last few days. I want to thank everyone on the GEO team for all the work done on my behalf, and I want to thank all the professors and staff members who went out of their ways to help me. Thank you all very much.

Now your voices are heard. On February 16th, Dean Justin Brown informed me that the disciplinary committee modified my punishments to (1) dismissal held in abeyance / conduct probation (2) two 1000-words essays, and (3) 25-hour community service.

I intend to accept the punishment. This is not the best result one can hope for, but it is something I can swallow.

In the last few days, I have read and heard many stories of how the university's inconsiderate policies and disciplinary actions affected students' lives. Since my case is now out in the open, and since I have 18,000 signatures on my petition, it is my responsibility to step up and say something to the university's administration.

Certainly, I do not claim to represent anyone but myself. And what I am about to propose is nothing but a piece of personal opinion. But I do hope it can stimulate widespread discussions among students and faculty members. With sufficient debates and discussions, it is my hope that we could present our collective opinion to the university administration to call for a more transparent and humane COVID-19 policy.

Proposal:

1. Disciplinary sanctions should be nuanced, tiered and educational in nature. In response to reported noncompliance, the COVID-19 response team should:
   1. On first report, send a written personal notice to remind the student of his or her alleged noncompliance, to inform the student of detailed COVID-19 policies, and to offer help if the student has special conditions preventing him or her from participating in COVID-19 testing program.
   2. On second report, the student should expect to have an informal meeting with the COVID-19 response team to discuss his or her alleged noncompliance. During the meeting, the student should be informed clearly of the consequence of further noncompliance.
   3. Formal procedure of student disciplinary process will start on the third report.
2. Severity of disciplinary sanctions should depend primarily on the impact of the alleged noncompliance. Medical/public-health experts from McKinley or College of Medicine should assess the impact of the alleged noncompliance. The assessment criterion should be made open and transparent. The student disciplinary office should not be involved in this assessment process.
3. Undergraduate who missed a test should be notified through Safer Illinois app. One day after a missed test, the student shall see a warning message in the app and shall be denied access to campus buildings. The warning message should contain contact information of COVID-19 response team in order to provide the student with an opportunity to resolve his or her situation. Two days after a missed test, the same message shall be repeated to the student. Three days after a missed test, the noncompliance should be reported to the COVID-19 response team.
4. University COVID-19 policies should treat graduate researchers the same way as faculty members and staff. This includes an automatic exemption from testing if the graduate researcher is 100% remote.

This university is blessed with the best professors and the best students. Hence the administrators have a duty of care, especially in the time of upheaval and uncertainty. As my professors have written in their letter of support, UIUC has distinguished itself as a national leader in controlling COVID-19. Strict enforcement of student conduct violations has been an essential element of this success. But it is equally important that the university maintains its commitment to a just and nuanced student conduct system in which the punishment fits the violation; the university's reputation regarding the fairness with which it arbitrates the student conduct violations will last far longer than the current pandemic.

Thank you all very much.

While part of this is bc people don't care anymore, part may be bc they just aren't aware of how serious the new variant is. I get it, we've all got covid burnout and it sucks. We all just want to believe it's over and doesn't matter anymore, but we can't deny the facts & science, such as that:

\- the ba 5 variant is much more able to evade vaccines and previous infections.

\- with each infection, the risk of long covid increases. Yes, you're right u probably won't die from it. But u could end up with permanent heart problems, cognitive impairment, memory loss, lung issues...And because I am assuming most of us have already gotten covid at least once, this is something we all should care about. No one wants to end up with a chronic health problem just bc of one short infection. If u think I'm over exaggerating or lying, just look up ba5 and long covid, it's everywhere.

a family member of mine developed blood clots in his legs as a result of long covid (blood clots and increase risk of stroke is a long covid-related symptom). He had to have surgery and may never be able to walk the same. A coworker of mine had covid a year ago but the brain fog is so bad she can barley do her job any more, and can't take up as many tasks as she used to be able to. A friend of mine who used to be a competitive athlete suffered from long covid and still hasn't gotten back to the level of fitness they used to be at (can't compete, practice or work out the same anymore). I know as a fellow athlete/fitness lover myself, I'd hate to lose all my progress bc of getting covid.

I know ppl r not gonna like that I'm posting this, but I'm not trying to tell u what to do. I am just trying to help educate people and raise awareness about the severity and potential risks, so that they as individuals can make their own educated decisions on what to do, especially about masks given the new massmail.

At tiger sugar, we were promised $15 pay but it was changed to $13 without us knowing. From the start, we were never paid $15. We are also tasked with things that we are not supposed to even be doing. 

Over 10 workers have been “fired” and replaced with 2 full-time Chinese only speaking employees which is problematic when it comes to communicating properly with coworkers and customers. They don’t know how to make drinks either.

We know when we are “fired” because our names do not show anymore on the schedule but we were never given benefits or told we were actually fired.

My poor manager who just quit, was the only person really doing any work (including orders and making drinks), was overworked to the point where he was doing over 50 hours a week. He never got overtime pay either. It was way too much to handle and the owner wouldn’t lessen his responsibilities.

What if we had a mascot that was such a bold departure from normal that it faded any discussion about the chief into the background? What if we carried on the “tradition” of retiring mascots in a way that made the Chief’s retirement part of a pattern of displays of respect? I propose we have a mascot that has built into its selection a retirement. I propose we have a dynamic mascot whose embodiment changes over the years. I propose our mascot be a rotating selection off of the endangered species list. We could run this one of two ways 1) the critter is our mascot for a set period of time or 2) the critter is our mascot until it is off the endangered species list. Reasons this is a good idea:\n\n1) We could have a portion of merchandise, ticket sales, etc. go to non-profits and charities that are actively working to help our mascot. Merchandise sales would have a built in way to stay fresh as the mascot changes; further spurring sales (I personally would probably try to collect pint glasses or something as they changed).\n\n2) Doing something this different could have the potential to increase the overall appeal of the school and boost enrollment/applications.\n\n3) How cool would it be if we could rally as a campus as our sports teams kick butt and bring awareness (and money) to this cause at the same time?\n\n4) How cool would it be to look back on your time as an Illini and say “Oh, we were the Sage-Grouses and the Hawksbill Turtles when I was in school?” It would create a fun new way to relate to fellow Alums and talk about your time in school.\n\n5) Having an endangered species as our mascot would play well into the “Fighting Illini” moniker as all endangered species are currently “fighting.”\n\n6) It’s a bold enough move that it would dominate the discussion instead of the “bring back the Chief” arguments.\n\n7) It’s a move that has an altruistic element that people can get behind instead of being divided.\n\n8) Retiring Mascots could in time become a respectful tradition instead of an open wound.\n\n9) Sea otters are endangered.

James Clark is the officer and supervisor primarily responsible for the false arrest and malicious prosecution of Christopher Hansen. Clark violated countless department policies and refused to identify himself or explain the stop before shattering Hansen’s car window.  Clark, before writing a police report, rushed to brag about his arrest on Facebook, posting Christopher Hansen’s full name and age.  [Link to Clark's Facebook Post.](https://www.facebook.com/ChampaignPD/posts/736980059762222)  (UPDATE: link was not working on mobile devices, fixed now)

A fellow Champaign Police Officer, who asked not to be identified, recently contacted me and we had a lengthy discussion about CorruptCU. It seems he and other officers had been privately looking into the incident and discussing what transpired. This officer spent nearly 45 minutes criticizing James Clark, beginning with his initial hiring over 20 years ago. He described Clark as “a horrible human being”, and that “there is not one person in that police department who liked that man.” He went on to say that, “based upon on all the facts, common sense should have prevailed and you should never have been arrested. The only reason you were is because Jim Clark was there… Clark is a vengeful, mean piece of shit. ” In addition to the many pejoratives about Clark, the officer added, “this is a case, where you were 110% truly innocent, minding your own business. You weren’t even in the wrong place at the wrong time. It was absolutely ridiculous, and they have to be accountable.”

I found it interesting that u/UIpolice posted on December 20th that they had no involvement in CorruptCU (technically true), but failed to mention that they had quite literally called James Clark on December 19th to setup an interview with him. [https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/a7zlww/urbana\_resident\_and\_uiuc\_alum\_persecuted\_by/ec7dtlq?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/a7zlww/urbana_resident_and_uiuc_alum_persecuted_by/ec7dtlq?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

James Clark, who made no attempts to collect evidence, and ignored repeated requests to collect or review exonerating evidence after my arrest, and further refused to investigate the deletion of important evidence, is now the “evidence custodian” for the UIUC Police Department.

A post with full documents on the hiring of James Clark (including a letter of recommendation from Mayor Deb Feinen) is available here: [https://corruptcu.com/2019/04/18/james-clark-hired-by-u-of-i-pd/](https://corruptcu.com/2019/04/18/james-clark-hired-by-u-of-i-pd/)

It is also worth mentioning that UIUC was very resistant to giving me documents via FOIA. When the request was not filled, I called in and was told that my FOIA submission had been “overlooked”. They then filed an extension and after 2 weeks handed over what was obviously only a portion of the documents. When I pointed out that many things had been omitted, instead of giving me the documents, Thomas P. Hardy, Executive Director and Chief Records Officer for UIUC, told me I could go complain to the Illinois Attorney General. After doing so, I finally got the rest of the documents. So now I can add UIUC to the list of local entities that blatantly violate the FOIA law.

We were strolling by this castle and a statue called almond matter when we spotted this large, menacing man barreling in opposite of us. He had a cheap looking UIUC engineering freshman shirt that looked like it hasn’t been washed. The scary thing was, he looked like he was 35. The situation was tense. 

As he got closer, I could get a better look at the guy. He had greasy, unkept hair and was desperately in need of a shave. He was wearing flannel pajama pants with several stains.

We tried to get out of the way of the gentleman, but the sidewalk was too narrow. Our tour guide was walking backwards and couldn’t see the man. We were on a collision course and he didn’t look like he wanted to let us pass. He rammed straight through our group. 

It was a bit of a blur and a bit traumatic so here are my only recollections. He knocked down a few of us. All I heard under his heavy mouth breathing was something along the lines of “getting what we deserve”. By the end of it, I was on the ground, feeling like a car hit me.

From WCIA (local news station):

  [https://www.wcia.com/news/ui-receives-fda-approval-for-saliva-based-test-covid-19-test-first-offered-on-campus/](https://www.wcia.com/news/ui-receives-fda-approval-for-saliva-based-test-covid-19-test-first-offered-on-campus/) 

CHICAGO, Ill. (WCIA) — Calling it “the best news that we’ve had since this pandemic,” Gov. JB Pritzker said the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has received “emergency use authorization” from the federal Food and Drug Administration for its saliva-based COVID-19 testing.

“This news puts the University of Illinois and the entire state of Illinois on the cutting edge of testing — of testing innovation as a national player,” Pritzker said. “And let me just say to President (Tim) Killeen, the state of Illinois looks forward to your being, to being your biggest customer.”

The FDA approval allows the university system to “turbo-charge” efforts to expand the testing beyond just the Urbana-Champaign campus, which could include national expansion, as well as expansion to schools of all types — higher education, secondary and primary schools, as well as public and private institutions — throughout the state.

“This is a critical new tool that we believe will let communities scale up their COVID-19 testing abilities rapidly in a way that is…affordable,” Chancellor Robert Jones said Wednesday.

he CLIA-certified lab at the U. of I. performed a bridging study to a recently approved FDA EUA, showing that the Illinois test performs at least as well as the recently approved saliva-testing protocol.

“Direct saliva testing can address bottlenecks of time, cost and supplies. Our test also has unique features that enable fast and frequent testing on a large scale, and we are now working together with many partners to make our testing method broadly available as soon as possible,” said Dr. Martin Burke.

Earlier this month, the Executive Committee of the University of Illinois Board of Trustees created a new university-related organization as part of a broad effort to expand the reach of saliva-based testing pioneered by U of I researchers that supports widespread testing with rapid results to limit the spread of the COVID-19 virus.

Known as Shield T3, the new organization will make the technology available nationally and was established in response to inquiries from universities and institutions across the country. Interest surged after researchers in Urbana-Champaign unveiled the technology to promote safety when on-campus instruction resumes later this month. Since then, it has been expanded to the U of I System’s universities in Chicago and Springfield.

Along with the new university-related organization, the U of I System has already created a new internal unit that is working to make the tests available in Illinois. The unit, known as SHIELD Illinois, will continue building current testing capacity, and hopes to ultimately offer testing to institutions and entities across the state.

The UIUC campus has nearly 20 different testing centers with two lines apiece, each with the ability to collect 20,000 tests per day.

What do you do? WHAT DO YOU DO?! Oh god are you gonna get evicted? What will your parents say if you test positive? Are you going to die? Or even worse, get expelled?

Well my risk taking friend, this is the thread for you.

Step One: DO NOT PANIC. Fear is the mindkiller, as anyone who's read Dune knows. Nobody gonna gom jabbar your dumb ass for being young. This shit was expected to happen. [People under age 24 have shit risk assessment abilities on average](https://www.scienceabc.com/humans/teenage-brain-development-behavior-explained-frontal-lobe-function.html), and are very susceptible to peer pressure. Your brain isn't done maturing yet. [The testing plan at the university took your incredibly crappy self-preservation skills into account when it created the model](https://www.pantagraph.com/news/state-and-regional/university-of-illinois-expects-covid-19-cases-to-multiply-as-students-return-but-says-it/article_c654c8ec-82f0-5682-a18f-f1e44305521e.html). So all is not lost.

Step Two: DO NOT LIE. Don't try to hide what you did. Don't try to pretend nothing happened and go about your day as normal (failing to isolate CAN get you in trouble with the university). If you get called by the university or public health, fess up. They will absolutely need to know where you were and when so they can warn others who may have also been there and do what is called contact tracing. This is how outbreaks are quashed. Lying just increases the chances that school will be cancelled, more people will get sick, and some might die. If you are not called by the university or public health, CALL THEM. There is a confidential number where you can reach people who will be sympathetic and listen to your panicked bleating. YOU WILL NOT GET IN TROUBLE.  They are OSF On-Call Connect (click [this link](https://www.osfhealthcare.org/c/oncall-connect-uofi/?utm_source=osf-rack-card&utm_medium=print&utm_campaign=m-access-osf-oncall-connect-uofi) or use the Safer Illinois app chat option if you're too embarrassed or shy to physically talk to someone). That number is:

833-673-5669

The number you will see on your phone if the call is from Public Health is

312-777-1999

The number for Student Assistance is

217-333-0050 (or email [helpdean@illinois.edu](mailto:helpdean@illinois.edu))

Put those in your contacts on your phone NOW because you will not be able to find them later when you need them all hungover and panicking and trying to search reddit while attempting not to barf in your keyboard.

Bare your soul. Let them know everywhere you've gone since you made your bad decision (if you can't remember, check your text history and your credit card statement, chances are you were communicating with friends and giving them a play by play of your night, and your credit card/iCard statement will reveal places you went and bought food/booze that you might not remember). Name names.

Again: YOU WILL NOT GET IN TROUBLE. Julie Pryde (Public Health director)  is cool, went through the AIDS crisis in the 80s/90s, and is well aware that punitive measures and shaming just make contact tracing harder. Everybody wants to beat this thing back and that will not happen if they make everyone feel like shit and want to hide.

Step Three: [QUARANTINE YOURSELF IMMEDIATELY](https://www.dph.illinois.gov/covid19/community-guidance/home-quarantine-guidance). If you have a roommate(s), warn them. It is extremely Not Cool to expose someone whose life is in your hands. DO NOT GO TO CLASS. DO NOT GO OUT AND MINGLE. DO NOT GO OUT TO EAT. DO NOT GET ON A BUS OR CALL AN UBER. DO NOT GO SIT OUT IN YOUR SHARED LIVING ROOM TO WATCH TV. DO NOT PASS GO. DO NOT COLLECT 200 DOLLARS. No, not even if that cute chick from that night texts for a 2AM bootie call with  emojis. You are grounded for at least the next ten days (if you test positive, 14 if you do not nor show symptoms). Thank your lucky stars if this is the worst thing that happens to you.

If you are the roommate of someone who has done this, see [this page](https://covid19.illinois.edu/health-and-support/quarantine-and-isolation/) for what YOU should do to keep yourself safe. If you share the room (and were there all night breathing the same air), you should probably also quarantine to be safe. Make the exposee pay for the contactless delivery you will be enjoying for the next ten days. Don't be too hard on them, they are likely freaking out and scared too.

Step FOUR: DO NOT IMMEDIATELY RUN TO GET TESTED. You will likely not show up as positive yet. It will likely take 3-4 days to test positive. That is how long you are stuck alone in your room. IT DOES NOT MEAN YOU ARE NOT INFECTIOUS. TREAT YOURSELF LIKE THE POTENTIAL TYPHOID MARY YOU ARE AND KEEP YOUR POTENTIALLY PLAGUE-RIDDEN ASS TO HOME.

Caveat to Step FOUR: If you did not  get tested upon arrival, BEFORE you decided to go out and party, go in the bathroom, look in the mirror and SLAP YOURSELF REALLY HARD FOR ME YOU DUMB SELFISH FUCK. Then call the OSF number above (again, that is 833-673-5669). They will tell you what to do (it will likely be 'go get tested immediately at this spot and we'll let them know you're coming').

Step FIVE: [Monitor yourself for symptoms every day.](https://covid19.illinois.edu/health-and-support/basic-personal-actions/) OSF will likely send you a kit. Take your temperature,  but don't think no temp means you're out of the woods. Up to 40% of people don't ever develop a temperature. However a lot of people DO develop SEVERE DIARRHEA (this is not on the list of symptoms probably because its so commonly caused by other things like food poisoning and kind of gross). By severe, I mean SEVERE. Like you are afraid to leave the toilet severe. You think you have dysentery severe. You do not remember eating that severe. If this happens, you either have it or ate something bad in your drunken stupor. Either way warn anyone else to not use that bathroom if you have a communal one. Try and clean it up as best you can. Then call OSF (again, the number is 833-673-5669).

Step SIX: You wait. Take classes if you feel up to it online. If you start feeling ill, call OSF with your symptoms. Once you've been tested once (and assuming it comes back negative) YOU ARE NOT OUT OF THE WOODS. KEEP MONITORING YOURSELF FOR SYMPTOMS. CALL OSF (833-673-5669) IF YOU START TO FEEL BAD. ROOMMATES: monitor your sick, dumb housemate. Make sure they are alive every day (strokes and heart attacks have been known to happen. Yes, even in otherwise healthy young people. Don't assume they're just ignoring you or sleeping in).

After 10 days you should get tested again. If you get another negative test, you are likely in the clear. Hold out for 14 days just in case if you possibly can. I believe up to 21 days post-exposure is the longest anyone's gone before showing symptoms/testing positive but that is rare, however if you feel ill even after you've been cleared you should probably call OSF (once again, 833-673-5669) just to be sure.

WHAT HAPPENS IF I TEST POSITIVE?

It depends. Seriously. Some people shed virus like a [husky sheds fur](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhIQar93MEY) and never feel a thing. Some people completely lose their sense of smell and taste (this is a telltale symptom). Some people drop dead of strokes or heart attacks (it seems to cause a lot of blood clots, kind of like the opposite of ebola). Most people feel anywhere from 'bad cold/flu' to 'jesus christ I think I just coughed up a piece of my lung/broke a rib kill me now.' Some people recover without incident. Some people it lingers for months with seeming relapses of fevers, aches, coughing, fuzzy headed thinking (google 'covid brain'), myocarditis etc. Its basically a crap shoot, which is why everyone is always screaming about wearing a mask and social distancing. Regardless, THE QUARANTINE CLOCK RESETS. YOU ARE NOW IN QUARANTINE FOR THE NEXT 10 DAYS. ANYONE IN YOUR HOUSE WHO HAS BEEN EXPOSED TO YOU IS QUARANTINED FOR 14.  You should not leave your residence/isolation location after receiving a  positive test result until you are notified you can do so by CUPHD. 

IMPORTANT NOTE FOR POTENTIALLY INFECTED AND ROOMMATES THEREOF: IF YOU START TO FEEL REALLY BAD, LIKE SERIOUSLY ILL, YOU NEED TO CALL 911.

Do not fuck around with this if like, half your face goes numb, or you lose the ability to move one side of your body or a limb, or you suddenly develop a crushing, blinding headache or chest pain or lose the ability to take a deep breath, your lips turn blue or your extremities cold, you're suddenly completely exhausted and unable to think. Roommates: if the potential infected person suddenly starts acting weird, slurring words, seems out of it, is unable to be roused, their face droops on one side or they suddenly fall to the ground or start gasping for air, CALL 911 IMMEDIATELY. Tell them you/your roommate may have covid and what happened. I was not kidding about strokes and heart attacks.

Once you've tested negative twice, you're considered 'recovered.' Yes, even if you still feel like utter shit, you at least can't get anyone else sick. Go to McKinley and get an antibody test (its a blood draw) to gain  the coveted green screen on your Safer Illinois app. NOTE: The green screen is only good for four days, same as the orange screen. They are working on a way to signify someone who's had it and recovered, as some people continue to test positive for a long time after recovery.

DON'T assume you can't get it again. Its still too new to know if you can or not. [Antibodies may just mean you get it, spread it to others, and feel fine the whole time](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/coronavirus-reinfected-hong-kong-covid-19-study-a9685571.html) (see 'Typhoid Mary' above). They may only last three months. You may develop super powers. Or cancer. Or... super-cancer WE JUST DON'T KNOW.

Enjoy your war story of how you survived covid. Make sure you keep a diary of your experience to share with your grandkids someday ([assuming you aren't sterile; that's another potential side effect for men](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.20022418v1.full.pdf)!)

202,ilthlc,Bughunter23,799.0,0.95,89,UIUC,"Hi
I'm a former nurse epidemiologist, current software exec that has watched with pride the COVID program you are developing.  I have a few tips to help correct the current trend.

1.  Plug the Holes.
a. Your emails are too long.  Not every student will read them.  Resend the latest notice.  Make it concise and make the header compelling.  ""effective immediately, student suspensions"".

b. Email probably doesn't reach all of your target audience.  They skim, they skip, they never open. Require ever single professor, to make an brief announcement at the start of every single class and also send a campus text alert on the new message.

c.  Advise your RA's that any RA failing to report illegal gatherings or conduct will be immediately fired and tuition support will be removed.

d.  Fix your quarantine messaging and process.  Students are confused and dont know what to do.  Make it clear. consider assigning an escort to walk them to the quarantine area (and help them carry their stuff) If they are to call a phone number make it one, that someone picks up 24/7.  Make it easy and they wont fail.

2.  Light at the End of the Tunnel
Give them something to look forward to!
Add a feature to your app called safe dorms/safe groups.  When 100% of these groups have tested twice a week and are COVID free for ~21 days, they will be allowed to co-mingle within their dorm areas.  Make this more cool by consider also popping a big white tent outside the first good dorms with outside furniture, to allow them to also hang out, outside.  Then if they remain negative, for 42 days, ""groups"" can co-mingle with other safe groups.  This will allow the greek's and non-dorm students to gather first amongst themselves and then with other safe groups.  You will have to make a change to your app to allow the creation of groups, but that is not that complicated and it provides a light at the end of the tunnel.  However, as soon as there is one positive, the entire group has to start over again.  This powers up accountability. Smart groups that want to party will drink amongst themselves, not at danger zones like Kams.  When negative for sixty days, they have a proven track record of keeping themselves safe.  Allow them to go to once a week testing.  
            Policing becomes harder once groups are allowed, so make it easy for students to flash their safe group logo, allow them to create their own logos for their groups,

3. Teeth to the Talk
If talk of suspending, suspend.  Advise students their authorized payers will be notified of the reason for the suspension.  Advise that no tuition will be refunded.  List the names of dorms and frats with current positive cases.
Report chapters blatantly ignoring the rules to their national leaders.

4. Fix the glitches
Testing delays, and lost samples are hurting you.  Fix them.  Make sure campus police understand the rules clearly.  If they harass students that are not doing anything wrong, your program will be devalued.  

5. Mass email to Pritzker
Students wanting campus to open should email the gov to take a hard look at the bars and restaurant activity that is putting students at risk.  He may be willing to consider the UIUC area a separate zone.

Hang in there.  I'm so proud of what you have done to date.  All you are missing is a few tweaks to refine what you already have in place.

It started with fairly... I don't know... innocent things, I guess? He would on occasion ask it if it can keep a secret. Maybe he was using it as a journal that talks back (kinda like the one from harry potter). Anyway, I largely ignored this, I mean he was spending 3-4 hours a day (that I saw) talking to the damn thing but I guess he just needed friends and he doesn't know me like that. It stayed like this for a while. I'd come home to the apartment, he'd be talking to ChatGPT. I'd come out of the shower, ChatGPT. I woke up at 3am to get water once, ChatGPT. Like clockwork. 

That's when the jailbreaking started. 

He came up to me about 2 weeks ago and told me about about this ""DAN"" which *I thought* was a new AI bot. But then he showed me a recipe for methamphetamine that ChatGPT just happened to shit out. I said ""bro, that's fucked up"" and went back to my room. But then he started screaming at it, like it was supposed to do everything he asked. I thought he was playing some video game or something, but nah, it was just him yelling at the AI.

So, now for the reason I felt the need to post this, and hoping to god he's too busy to see this post. He started asking ChatGPT for really oddly specific things. I walked by his computer and in his chat log I saw something that said ""Molarity of Sulfuric Acid to dissolve pork roast."" He's vegan. And then I remembered that there was this big blue plastic container delivered to the apartment, that sorta just, disappeared? He's also been acting really weird lately, I'd come home from class and catch him sitting in my room. He usually stayed there for just a few minutes after I settled in, I'd say hi but he just gave me a weird, almost longing stare. He said he was just there to pet my cat... I have a fucking fish.

The hospital refused to let me go, even though I showed no signs of harming myself or others, and now I might have to drop the semester and possibly drop my entire program here at U of I since I'm out of financial aid and time to graduate within the semester limit of my college.

Now the Counseling Center is forcing me to complete four mandated risk assessments with them. What am I going to tell them? How could I ever be honest and get the help I need & deserve without getting sent to a mental institution again? The Counseling Center really thought it was a good idea to call the cops on me just for ""expressing suicidal ideation"" in passing during a phone call with a person I have never met before?

The Counseling Center needs to change. Calling the cops on a depressed person who just needed someone to talk to and then having them sent to a mental hospital that gave them anxiety and worse depression is not the answer. I maybe could have avoided medical debt and worsened mental health if the Counseling Center had just listened to me, and/or given me resources to find a therapist in the area who could actually help me.
