0,10leb60,Prestigious-Fun-6942,259.0,0.74,238,Cornell,"I’m quitting DoorDash, and more importantly, I’m disgusted with tipping behavior I’ve seen from Cornell students over the past few months. Today was the last straw - several $0 and $1 tips despite heavy snow. I’m risking my car and livelihood to make rent, and today I came inches from getting into a wreck despite driving under the speed limit. 

This is indecent and insufferable. I’ve gotten $1-2 tips on $50-100 of food and held my tongue. I’ve talked with other people who reported worse here across the service industry, not just on DoorDash.

College students everywhere are poor and/or stupid, and you don’t get that excuse here at Cornell. How you treat someone when you think other people won’t see it and you can get away with it indicates your true character. A $0 tip says a lot more about you than a Canada Goose or Montblanc jacket when you’re the one who is staying home safe and warm.

Understand: People are still recovering from the ongoing and complex effects of the pandemic. People are providing services for you on the other side of tech and convenience. People need to live.

Do better. (And if you have a problem with this post, you’re missing the point)

2,10ybmgu,KrzysisAverted,380.0,0.97,67,Cornell,"As the title says. Just putting this out as a PSA for everyone.

I order a fair amount of my food through Grubhub or similar. Unfortunately, over the last few years, a small handful of Ithaca restaurants have resorted to flooding Grubhub with an asinine number of ""ghost kitchens"" that are really all the same business, under a façade of varying names.

What is a ""ghost kitchen""? A ""ghost kitchen"", sometimes called a ""virtual restaurant"", is a restaurant operating under multiple names. Some people consider this a clever marketing trick, but in the way it's being done in Ithaca, it's closer to blatant fraud. One restaurant--with a single location, same staff, same owner, same cooks, etc., can operate two, five, or ten ""virtual restaurants"" on sites like Grubhub, giving people who order delivery the false impression that they are supporting several different business when really they are just repeatedly ordering from the same one or two.

The upsides of this are obvious: If one physical restaurant can have itself listed as 5 or 10 different ""ghost kitchens"" on Grubhub, it is more likely to appear 3 or even 4 times within the top 20 results, thereby getting an unfair amount of virtual ""real estate"" on Grubhub and pushing out other local restaurants that play fair and avoid such deceptive practices.

If a ""ghost kitchen"" gets a bad review (the food sucks, it gave someone food poisoning, etc.) then they can simply close that one ""restaurant"" on Grubhub without their real business going under--and by tomorrow, there will be two or three more virtual restaurants to replace it! It's a hydra's-heads situation; the restaurant has nothing to lose and no incentive to maintain a good reputation.

Below I will go through the list of the first two pages of Ithaca restaurants on Grubhub (where this is most egregious) as it's presented to me (because the order of restaurants will differ for each user), right now, at 7:30PM on February 9th 2023, and point out the ""virtual restaurants"" that I've spotted so far. This is by no means a definitive list, but it's something.

Hook & Co Fish Fry - **This is a virtual restaurant. The address listed, 111 N Aurora St, is the address of Ithaca Ale House.**

Ithaca Halal Food - **This is a most likely a virtual restaurant. The address listed, 215 E State St, doesn't correspond to any real restaurant**

La Quesadilla - **This is a virtual restaurant. The address listed, 310 Stewart Ave, is the address of LUNA's delivery kitchen.**

Jack's Collegetown Grill - this is a real local business

Munchies - **This is a virtual restaurant. The address listed, 310 Stewart Ave, corresponds to LUNA's delivery kitchen.**

\*\*\*

So there you go. Out of the first \~45 restaurants, 15 are ""ghost kitchens"" / ""virtual restaurants""! That's 1 out of every 3 restaurants listed on the first two pages of grubhub. And nowhere on the pages of these ""virtual restarants"" does it clearly say, ""Operated by LUNA's Street food"" etc--which would at least be somewhat forgivable. **Out of those 15 virtual restaurants, 9 are run by LUNA's street food. So a single business with three physical locations (downtown, collegetown, and delivery kitchen) is running an additional NINE virtual kitchens that pretend to be different, unaffiliated businesses.**

This is madness.

Clearly, this is not sustainable. A few bad actors (in this case, **mostly** LUNA's) are pushing regular local businesses out of the delivery market. If every restaurant did this, Grubhub would be an absolute cesspool of fake restaurants where you never know what's what and everything is a facade operated by someone else. Clearly, that's not good for people. So if you can, I would suggest reporting these virtual restaurants to Grubhub to try to get them taken off the platform--but most importantly, **avoid ordering from these ""virtual restaurants"". If you order from them, you're supporting their deceptive practices.**","[{'author': 'Mushimishi', 'body': 'Was going to say before I read it all, you can just say they’re all Luna’s/Jack’s/Pronto/Purity and co lol.\n\nThe menus are also pretty copy paste.', 'score': 135, 'created_utc': 1675990424.0}, {'author': 'PhantomSeahorse', 'body': 'To add on to this, Jack’s, Luna, and Pronto all have the same owner', 'score': 109, 'created_utc': 1675996152.0}, {'author': 'MagicalQaz', 'body': ""Honestly best practice I developed when these first started showing up was if there was a restaurant I didn't recognize but was interested in trying, I'd just look at the address they left for pickup on google maps and that's pretty much all you need to do to sus it out.

The things he was saying to you were so nasty and mean that I could not believe it. Obviously you knew your paper needed work, that's why you were trying to get help. But nobody deserves to be put down like you were, no matter how rough your paper is. 

Who knows what you have going on in your life right now. Not every paper is going to be your best work and there's nothing wrong with that. I mean damn, even if you're the worst writer on the planet, that doesn't make you stupid and certainly doesn't mean you can't be successful and happy.

I was very upset overhearing these things. I would have stepped in to say something but I have autism and sometimes struggle with knowing what is appropriate to do in certain situations. When I got home, I talked it over with my wife and decided to make this post hoping you see it.

I would like to offer to help you with your paper. I am not the strongest writer,  but I'm certain that nothing could have hurt your progress more than the words of that jerk. I am glad your other friend was there to stick up for you as much as she could.

As an alumni, I am ashamed that that guy represents a part of Cornell, and said such mean things to you. You made it this far, you need to know that you deserve to be here and that you can do anything. 

Feel free to reach out for help with your paper, I'm sure there might be other folks on this sub that would be happy to help as well.","[{'author': 'huds0nian', 'body': 'You should volunteer for EARS or something- this was super uplifting to read', 'score': 72, 'created_utc': 1678422215.0}, {'author': 'Public_Intern_2622', 'body': ""Don't mind the trolls.

I don\'t know what else occurred to those folks, but the prof (Tim Tittelbaum) did give the class a stern talking-to.  It made an impression on me because while I didn\'t copy that assignment, I did work on it with someone, so I was scared that I was one of those caught.  From that point on, I would always put ""I worked with XXX on this assignment"" on things I handed in since working with people was fine, and I wanted to be up-front in case I was accused of cheating (which I wasn\'t).

The thinking being is that if all they did was change variable names and so on, the compiled size would be the same.  Yes, we caught a fair number with that method.\n\nAnother way we did it was just to have the students meet with a grading assistant for a few minutes to demo and explain their program.  Anyone who couldn\'t explain it well was then given a careful look.  I had two people come in back-to-back where the first woman did a great job (A+ work), and then the next person was a man who could barely explain it and it was clearly the same program.

11,bktfvb,Pryde_and_Wisdom,257.0,0.98,10,Cornell,"For context, I had spent the entire afternoon studying in Olin Library, took the bus back to North Campus, dropped off my stuff, then went to college town with a couple of friends to eat dinner.

I got back to my dorm around 9pm today (Saturday May 4th) and found my roommate passed out on the bed. Trying not to disturb him, I poked around the room trying to find my backpack in the dark, only my foot wasn't hitting anything. With alarms going off in my head, I flipped on the light switch and confirmed to my dread that there was no backpack on the floor of the room.

With all the adrenaline in the world, I sprinted from North Campus to Olin (taking a few fast walking breaks because running is tiring) to find my backpack. I entered the downstair's study area, praying to God that my backpack was still there. Unfortunately, it wasn't. I went to the library's main desk and asked if a backpack was found missing. I explained how the backpack had my initials on it, how my computer had my name and phone number on it, and how literally every single notebook for every single class I was taking had my name on it to identify the backpack as mine. As you can probably guess, there was no backpack in the lost and found.

I left the library and promptly yelled out ""FUCK"" in the middle of the A&S quad. I had lost all hope. I dejectingly walked down Libe Slope to wait for a bus to take me back to North. While waiting, a bus - the 92 bus - came from the opposite direction to take kids down to college town. Suddenly, light bulbs frantically lit up in my head because I had taken the 92 bus earlier that day. I went onto the bus and frantically searched for a backpack, and wouldn't you know, there was no backpack on the bus. I even asked the bus driver if there was anything reported missing, and she said I had to call the bus lost and found, which wouldn't even open until Monday.

At this point, I got off the bus near the Schwartz Center and was cursing myself to hell for being such an idiot. On my gloomy stroll back to North, I stopped off at WSH on the off chance my backpack was there. I hadn't gone to WSH at all that day, but you see, earlier on in the semester, my close friend had also lost his backpack. After a week of not finding it, his backpack mysteriously appeared in the main lobby of WSH. Unfortunately for me, he is a 1000x more lucky than me, or at least, I would have to wait at least a week for similar luck to occur for me. So, it was back to my depressing journey back to North Campus.

I got back to my dorm room feeling as if I was the most unfortunate person to have ever lived. Finals are coming up, paper deadlines are nearing, and I had neither notebooks to study nor a computer to write said papers. I drudgingly tore off my clothes and went into the shower to drown my miseries. As my luck this night would have it, I realized I was out of soap whilst in the middle of my shower. I got out of the disappointing lukewarm shower and threw myself onto my bed, ready to just fall asleep and have the night end with some hope that I would wake up and realize my misfortunate was but a dream. Funnily enough, I didn't land on my pillow; rather, I face planted onto something hard and uneven. ""No, it can't be,"" I thought. But it was. I face planted right onto my backpack. ""HOLY SHIT!!!"" was the exact phrase that left my mouth. Apparently, my roommate had came back drunk earlier in the day, tripped on my backpack, and proceeded to throw the bag onto my bed. My bed was so messy that the backpack just got hidden under the blankets. Truly, I'm still in disbelief.

TL;DR I lost my backpack, and after a frantic search, found said backpack waiting for me on my bed.","[{'author': 'Pinuzzo', 'body': 'I was expecting the backpack to have ended up in the shower :(', 'score': 76, 'created_utc': 1557031447.0}, {'author': 'altruyzm', 'body': 'This story was better than Endgame.', 'score': 128, 'created_utc': 1557029022.0}, {'author': 'andrewthedude101', 'body': 'Hey but at least you found your backpack amiright\n\nOn a more serious note though, I’m glad you eventually found it.

It was super distracting and honestly I think I did worse than I wanted on the exam because of it. I tried raising my hand pretending I had a question about the prelim so that a TA would come and see him and get him to stop but when the TA came he kept going and the TA didn't see anything :(

16,e40ya8,academictrash26,273.0,0.99,12,Cornell,"A Winter Storm will impact the Northeast Sunday and Monday. Heading back to Cornell University? We’ve got you covered. Read on for a detailed forecast of the winter weather.

OVERVIEW - Snow will develop tomorrow morning around 9-10 AM in Ithaca (earlier SW, later NE) becoming moderate/heavy at times before mixing with sleet/freezing rain midday tomorrow. A lull is expected mid/late tomorrow afternoon before heavy snow returns tomorrow night. Moderate/heavy snow will continue through the day on Monday before tapering off Monday evening. The graph in the first image gives a good general idea of what to expect hour-by-hour in Ithaca in terms of precipitation intensity (top precip bar), and type (the next four bars).

TODAY 11/30/19 there is *no* snow expected. If you are travelling today from anywhere on the East Coast, or can rearrange your plans to travel this afternoon, you will not experience any interruptions as high clouds slowly spill into the northeast.

TOMORROW MORNING (6-10 AM 12/1/19) snow will be moving into the area from the southwest. If you have an early flight from Detroit, it may be delayed but SW Michigan is expecting mostly rain, so you should be able to get out. This also applies to early flights from DC. (See Image 2)

TOMORROW MORNING (6-10 AM) if you're driving through Pennsylvania, be extremely careful as roads will be covered in ice due to freezing rain. Interstates should be ok as road crews apply salt to keep surfaces wet, but back roads may be very slippery. Allow extra time to get here! (See Image 3)

TOMORROW MORNING (6-10 AM) if you're driving in from the west (Buffalo, Ohio, etc.) expect rain until you get to the PA/NY border, then precipitation will change over to a mix of ice/sleet/snow. Allow plenty of extra time to get here as you'll need to take it slow

TOMORROW MORNING (6-10 AM) if you're driving in from the east (NYC, Boston, etc.) expect dry conditions until 8-10 AM when a mix of snow and sleet will begin falling. If you can get to Ithaca by 10 AM, you should avoid substantial delays. (See Image 4)

MIDDAY TOMORROW (10 AM-2 PM), we'll see a burst of heavy snow and sleet here in Ithaca likely between 10 AM and 2 PM. If you're planning on arriving during this time, expect significant delays as traffic will be moving very slowly across the entire Central NY region. (See Image 5)

MIDDAY TOMORROW (10 AM-2 PM) if you're heading through SW NY (Buffalo, Jamestown, etc.) OR north through PA, you'll be moving quite slowly through heavy freezing rain/sleet. If you're heading south from ROC/SYR OR east from ALB, you'll be moving slowly through moderate/heavy snow.

MIDDAY TOMORROW (10 AM-2 PM) if you're flying into ITH/ROC/SYR, delays are likely and cancellations are possible given the onset of moderate/heavy snow and sleet.

TOMORROW AFTERNOON (2 PM-6 PM) snow/mixed precip will be tapering off to the west of Ithaca as drier air moves in aloft. If you're heading in from Buffalo or Ohio, you won't encounter much precipitation until you're into the Finger Lakes, but roads may still be slick. (See Image 6)

TOMORROW AFTERNOON (2 PM-6PM) heavy snow will be pivoting northeast of Ithaca, making travel very difficult if you're coming from NYC/CT/ALB/SYR. We strongly advise leaving as early as possible if you're travelling from these areas!

TOMORROW AFTERNOON (2 PM-6 PM) if you're flying into ITH/ROC/SYR, expect significant delays and/or cancellations as airport operations become heavily impacted by heavy snow. If you can make arrangements to get on an earlier flight, it would definitely be worth it!

TOMORROW EVENING (6 PM-10 PM) We'll see a bit of a lull in precipitation during this time as the storm hops over the Appalachian mountains and redevelops in New Jersey. Expect light freezing rain/sleet to switch over to light snow here in Ithaca while heavy snow falls ALB-BOS (See Image 7).

TOMORROW EVENING (6 PM-10 PM) If you're driving in from the west or south (Buffalo/OH/PA/NYC/etc.) you'll encounter only light precipitation, much of which will be rain or freezing rain until you get close to Ithaca. Roads may still be slick, but overall you should be OK.

TOMORROW EVENING (6 PM-10 PM) If you're driving in from the north (ROC/SYR) you'll encounter light to moderate snow which will make roads slick but not impassible. If you're willing to go slow, you should be fine driving during this time.

TOMORROW EVENING (6 PM-10 PM) If you're driving in from the east (ALB/BOS), you'll encounter very heavy snow and treacherous road conditions on I-90 and I-88. If it's at all possible, don't drive through here during this time! Snowfall rates will be >2"" per hour

TOMORROW EVENING (6 PM-10 PM) If you have a flight into ITH/ROC/SYR during this time, you'll likely encounter some delays, but planes should be able to land after they clear off the snow from earlier in the afternoon.

TOMORROW NIGHT (10 PM-4 AM) Bands of heavy snow will develop again over the Ithaca area as the storm strengthens near NYC. If you're not here by midnight, it's probably best to wait until later in the day on Monday. Snow could fall at rates of 1-2"" per hour. (See Image Eight)

MONDAY MORNING (4 AM-10 AM) bands of moderate to heavy snow will remain over the Ithaca area as the storm remains more or less stationary near Long Island. Travel from the east or southeast (ALB/BOS/NYC/CT) will be extremely difficult while conditions will improve to the west. (See Image 9)

MONDAY MORNING (4 AM-10 AM) if you're flying into ITH/ROC/SYR, expect significant delays and/or cancellations as heavy snow will be a challenge for airport crews to keep up with. If you can get on a flight tomorrow AM, that would be ideal but otherwise, your best bet is Tuesday

MONDAY MIDDAY/AFTERNOON (10 AM-6 PM) moderate snow will continue through the day on Monday from Ithaca east into New England. Travel from the west will improve, but roads east of Ithaca will remain treacherous as heavy snow continues to fall in eastern NY/New England. (See Image 10)

MONDAY EVENING (6 PM-10 PM) snow will taper off as NW winds bring drier air into the region and the storm moves into the Gulf of Maine. Roads will remain hazardous to the east of Ithaca, but you should be ok if you're heading in from Buffalo or points SW.
(See Image 11)

With that being said, we need to make this sub even better. If Ivies get on us over anything we need a sub to rub in their face. That's why I propose this one secret doctors hate to make your sub bigger: upvote downvote icons that represent Cornell


Harvard and Yale both have them and we can't let them boast their prestige like that, we need to show them we're on equal playing field. I'm thinking the upvote can be the Cornell logo and the downvote can be the okenshield stir fry.

19,ehtjso,rwaterbender,320.0,0.99,13,Cornell,"As the decade comes to a close and we draw 10 years closer to the impending climate apocalypse, the moderators of r/Cornell thought the timing was apt for a history lesson, because we know how much y'all love breadth requirements.   
  
The Cornell subreddit was, apparently, created roughly 10 years ago by u/drboda, who has been inactive for the last 10 years and has fewer posts on his account than I can count on one hand. It is truly remarkable that the spirit of this subreddit's founder has survived intact in its current users. Speaking of which, we have gone from just u/drboda and his alts to 16,674 readers at the time of writing, of which at this time approximately 22 AEP majors are active. We've also grown to a daily subscription rate in the mid double digits, and a monthly view rate of over 2 million for each of the last 2 months, of which, again, about 22 were unique. Through that time, we've seen moderators come and go, including u/laveritecestla (AEP '18) and u/TheD3xus (AEP MS '19), who recently graduated and who you may be familiar with. Some grad student and alumni lurkers may even be familiar with even older mods such as u/ConvexPreferences (unflaired), u/Enyo287 (graduation date unknown), u/TheIndigoSky (AEP '14) and u/SamuelGompers (EP '13), who had to be removed by force by reddit admins some time ago. He was actually so old AEP hadn't yet rebranded and was known as just EP. Some speculate this is due to Cornell's recent trend of grade inflation, before which there were no As given. Let that serve as a reminder: things could always be worse.     
  
If you're currently a Cornell student, you were probably between 7-14 years old at the start of the decade. Some of you probably spoke no English at that time or lived in a totally different country. Many of you probably didn't even know what Cornell was, or had never thought about going to college at all. We're 100% sure you were all fucking nerds tho.     
     
The world has changed a lot since 2010. Back then Two and a Half Men with Charlie Sheen was one of the most popular shows on television. People watched the Office on NBC, not Netflix. Snapchat didn't exist and Uber was a year old. The most popular song of 2010 was TiK ToK. Now it's an app, and owned by China.   
  
Cornell has changed a lot too. In 2010 our President was not Martha Pollack, a CS theorist, but James Skorton, a cardiologist. Imagine hiring someone to run a university who makes financial decisions like majoring in psychology. Martha has an h-index of 51. We didn't make that up, fucking chad she is. David motherfucking Gries has an h-index of 40. Who has more programming experience now, bitch?  
  
Some of the people reading this are probably ED admits or even RD applicants, so it seems appropriate to discuss how the university has changed in this regard, too. For the class of 2023, Cornell had an overall admission rate of 10.6%, and an ED rate of 22.6%. For the class of 2014, the statistics were 18.4% and 32.7%, respectively. By contrast, Harvard's admission stats were 7% for RD and no one knows the EA rate because they apparently didn't have it. Cornell's RD rate in 2018 was 8%, to put that in perspective. Idk about the rest of you, but this was actually more in line with current numbers than I expected. Notably, just 4 years earlier (Class of 2010) the admissions rate was actually 25%, with an ED rate of 40% for Cornell, and 9% and 20% for Harvard. I know this because I accidentally looked up these statistics instead of the relevant ones from a decade ago. Oops.    
    
Speaking of mistakes, let's go over some of the big ones. The 2010s looked so promising coming in, and yet we all ended up at Cornell. We are sincerely disappointed in all of you. More seriously, we made many mistakes this decade as a species, and learned from few of them. I'm going to get political for a moment. In 2010, we finally came together to give healthcare to the American people. 10 years later, we need GoFundMe to cover basic operations. In 2010, we elected the most conservative generation of politicians ever to the US government. Now, in 2019, we are poised to do the same again. Globally, Occupy Wall Street and the Arab Spring signaled a departure from the systemic oppression of earlier eras. Today, people in Hong Kong fight to defend their basic liberties from a dictator, and we deface even meager symbols of support for their people. But hey, at least we got some good memes out of it.           
   
Perhaps the greatest growth in the 2010s has been in the meme sector. One of the most popular memes of 2010 was a picture of Keanu Reeves. People still get massive karma with the same exact picture of Keanu Reeves. In 2010, people got their memes on reddit and cheezburger. Now, people still get their memes on reddit. Truly a transformative decade it has been.    
  
We want to give a shoutout to the r/Cornell community. Y'all are pretty dank. This community is by far the best Ivy shitposting subreddit, not that we really have any competition. But we are also helpful, welcoming, and insightful. Everyone in this subreddit contributes positively to the community, and we all really enjoy helping to keep this community spam-free for all of you.   
    
Here's to the continued perpetual growth of the AEP major, and another decade as the #1 Ivy shitposting sub. Whether you had a great decade or a shitty one, keep in mind: in just 100 more years, you'll finally be allowed to talk about 2110 finals on this sub again, and maybe Gries will even join you himself. Until then, shut the fuck up, and have a happy new year.

As I open the door and exit my dorm, swirls of white powder bite my face and my hands. As hordes of freshmen struggle their way through the Balch Courtyard, I realize that my imagination and prospects of frolicking in the snow had been deeply misguided.  I take a deep breath and, as my face slowly numbs over, reluctantly join this Great North migration.

I may have not known who was walking besides me this morning, but when we trudged downhill side by side together, persisting through the great Ithaca winds, we all became brothers and sisters in arms. I slip down some frozen ice and hurt my knee, but a woman pulls me up and helps me continue on this arduous, perilous, tortuous journey. I can no longer see the horizon. The edges of Rockefeller hall are no longer well defined. Am I fainting? Is this it for me? Am I really willing to put myself through this for a physics lecture?

As I draw closer and closer to my destination, I notice more and more people walking the opposite direction as I. Are they coming back from class or from battle? A holy messenger in the form of a 20-year old student yells, ""Classes are cancelled! Classes are cancelled! Classes are cancelled!"" Do I trust this man and return home to the sweet comforts of my bed and the gentle heat of my dorm? Or do I march onwards? How do you know if you are listening to the horn of Gabriel or witnessing the evil tricks of ad-Dajjal?

Then a divine message from above. ""Ithaca campus classes are cancelled 2/7."" There is a noticeable pause in the line of people trudging uphill, a feeling of tension and confusion that permeates the air.

Moments pass, and we turn around and walk back to North campus, not as students struggling to get to class, but as free beings about to enter a day of possibility and liberty.

23,f4abxz,StarksTwins,296.0,0.94,43,Cornell,"Last night a young woman got on the bus, when she realized she forgot her student ID at home. 

The bus driver tried to kick her off the bus. She, nor any of her friends, had the $1.50 for the toll. She literally had to go passenger to passenger and beg for money. If my girlfriend didn’t have a bunch of random change in her pocketbook, she would’ve been forced off. 

To me, that should be absolutely unacceptable. 

For one, she’s a Cornell student, it was after 7:00, and the ride were free anyways. 

For two, it was **-7°** outside. 

And lastly, it was midnight. 

I feel like someone should be ashamed of themselves for trying to force young woman at midnight in literally deadly temperatures to walk home because she didn’t have a dollar 50. 

Does anyone know a good person from TCAT to reach out to about the situation? Is the situation even worth reaching out for? Like I get it, she shouldn’t have forgotten her ID.

27,fi71eo,stupidlyugly,417.0,0.98,11,Cornell,"Hey everyone, 

I've been following this sub lately because my daughter is a student at Cornell.  (Dear old dad got his degree from the relatively pedestrian University of California system, so right off the bat, I'm not as smart as any of you)

We live in Texas, and my daughter arrived in Dallas last night on a previously planned weekend visit.  

We decided yesterday that it was probably wise for her to simply not return to campus, and we hoped for the best regarding scheduled mid-terms next week. 

I'm very relieved that the university decided to suspend classes today as she doesn't have to worry about negotiating with her professors.  We were really worried that if she went back on Monday, she might not be able to come back home at the end of March. 

Anywho, in following all your posts, I completely understand how stressed out everybody is.  This is certainly an unprecedented situation, and trust me, the old people are just as confused as you are and we're all trying to get through it. 

My heart goes out to the seniors who face missing graduation.  There is no spin to put on that -- it sucks. 

The best thing I can tell you is that someday when you have grandchildren, and you want to bore them to death with stories of the old days while you sip on your tipsy juice and they're getting all fidgety, this story in your lives is going to be a doozy. 

Hang tough Cornellians. It's (probably) not the end of the world.  And if it is, fuck it -- you got out of prelims for a while.  

Also, I think it's only fair that you declare both your men's and women's hockey teams national champions.  Hang those banners proudly!

28,fie8la,MemeFrom94,686.0,1.0,4,Cornell,"Hello, 

sorry to interrupt your memes, trust me it's not something I enjoy doing, but in this chaotic moment I feel compelled to write this. 

I am a dining employee from Willard Straight Hall in my first year working for Cornell Dining. I wanted to take a moment away from all of the craziness that is happening this semester to show my appreciation for the students of Cornell.   


When I first accepted my position at Cornell, I was terrified at the thought of working around so many people. I have had social anxiety issues for over a decade now, and having a constant reminder of the bad in the world through media has never made things easier for me. Making the step to work for Cornell Dining was a huge hurdle for me mentally that I still struggle with from time to time, but I can tell you, that those days are becoming less and less the longer I work at Cornell. A large part of why these days are becoming less frequent is due to the outstanding character of the students of Cornell.

&#x200B;

There are so many of you that I get to make pizzas for on a daily basis. I see many of you multiple times a week, and even the few of you that I only get to interact with every once in a while constantly remind me how great the Cornell community is! I've worked in food service since I was 16 years old and in every other job I've worked, I've always felt like I'm ""just the guy making this persons food"", however; that changed significantly when I started working at Cornell. At Cornell, there hasn't been one time where I have felt disrespected, or just felt like the guy making your food. I constantly feel as though many of you genuinely care about us dining employees, and you truly appreciate the effort we make!  


I probably wouldn't have ever made this post until this last week. With all the chaos, and madness surrounding the Coronavirus and what it means for everyone on campus one thing became shockingly clear to me, there is no where else in the world I'd rather be working right now than Cornell. In a time where many of you are scared, and worried about what comes next for you, a lot of you still took a moment to ask a lot us dining employees what all of this meant for us and our jobs. 

&#x200B;

I have never felt more cared for by strangers in my life than I have felt this week. A student even took the time to write our bosses an email saying how much they appreciated the work we have done for them, and the seamless transition we made to make our dining halls as safe as we possibly can during this time. If you happen to read this, I want to make sure you know that your letter made so many people feel good about what we do, there were tears in the eyes of multiple people in the room as the email was read aloud to all of us. This moment is incredibly scary for us as we aren't sure exactly whats going to happen to dining over the next couple of weeks since it seems like everything could change an hour from now but knowing that there is an entire campus of students who genuinely care about our well being honestly means the world to us all.

&#x200B;

Lastly, due to all of this craziness, I hate the fact that I didn't get a chance to say goodbye to many of the seniors who have already left campus that I was able to make food for regularly and at many points get to have conversations with. If any of you happen to be reading this, I wish you all nothing but the absolute best and I'm so sorry you're not able to spend your last semester as I'm sure you envisioned it, but there is no doubt in my mind that many of you are going to change the world for the better since many of you have already done that for my life.

&#x200B;

I look forward to seeing you all when everyone can come back to campus, I know things are crazy right now but I have nothing but faith in you all to absolutely crush it for the remainder of this semester...now back to the memes.","[{'author': 'Dieneforpi', 'body': 'This is wonderful to hear and makes me proud to be a student here.

29,fra9ll,ProfessorMeowSteve,339.0,0.97,6,Cornell,"Much ado has been made over the various grading systems that Cornell could implement this semester, but I’m surprised that nobody has suggested the following policy that would both settle the grading debate and also the BRB problem faced by students:

All Cornell dining plans (that I’m aware of) provide students with some amount of BRB’s at the start of each semester. I propose that professors grade assignments as they normally would, but before returning grades to students they would multiply each student’s grade by the ratio of that student’s remaining BRB balance to the amount of BRB’s allocated to that student at the beginning of the semester. For example, say Bill has the House Meal Plan, which provides $400 in BRB’s per semester. If Bill has $200 remaining BRB’s and scores 100 on a test, then they would receive a final grade of a 50. This might seem unfair, but recognize that rationing is important in these times, not just of food, medicine, and toilet paper, but also of happiness. Bill experienced joy from spending $200 BRB’s throughout the semester, so the unhappiness he experiences when he receives a failing grade in a core class that he worked really hard in balances out his previously experienced joy, leaving Bill in a state of happiness equilibrium.

Of course, not all students have dining plans, so what should be made of their situation? Since these students have a level of detachment from Cornell and campus life, they should automatically get an “S” that stands for “Strange” because they’re not like the rest of us. If they want a letter grade then they should be given the opportunity to forsake personal economy in the name of conformity by signing up for a Cornell meal plan despite their inability to use it. 

One last point of interest is the fact that BRB’s carry over from fall semester to spring semester. Thus, one could theoretically have carried over BRB’s from fall semester and not spent many BRB’s from their current semester’s allotment and ended up with a BRB ratio greater than 1. There is no problem in this, as it rewards students who believed in the validity and growth of BRB’s as a currency. With the recent hits to the values of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, allowing students to have, say, a 125% grade multiplier will assure that BRB’s don’t experience a similar drop in value faced by other mediums of exchange.

I shall bring forth this proposal directly to Martha, and I expect it to be adopted very soon. I apologize to any of you who spent all of your BRB’s at Bear Necessities or Jansen’s, but know that this plan is the only fair solution.","[{'author': 'Hikarinvisible', 'body': 'Grade based on how many times you ate at Okenshields during the semester \nIf it’s more than 3, you get a C-', 'score': 66, 'created_utc': 1585510062.0}, {'author': 'mikaaaa199', 'body': ""I would disagree with you on one point here.

I don't think a lot of people understand what others are going through and generalize stuff, so here's an anecdote that isn't representative of the whole because there are no surveys relating people at Cornell with what grading choice they advocated.

I'm a low income student. I'm also a minority. This of course extends to my family. I have 6 siblings, 4 of which moved out of our house already, leaving me the oldest of the children left living with my parents. My family is 3-months behind on mortgage now, in-part because we've had to send a lot of that money to my older sister who's job as a waitress isn't doing well right now. If we miss another payment, it's eviction time.  I've applied to multiple jobs already because we need money coming in, this will obviously get in the way of my studies but who cares, I'm probably a C student anyways, right?

Well actually, this is the one time I can brag about my situation before I get into the depressing bits. I'm a really good student and I'm proud of that, sophomore with ~3.9 gpa in engineering and that was staying on course during this semester too, getting above a std dev over mean on all my prelim 1s and an A on all my essays so far. I also really wanna go to grad school. But we'll come back to all that, now a bit of somber shit to soak up this r/humblebrag.

So that was over a week ago, but things progress in pandemics. So a different older sister (we'll call her sister 2) of mine has asthma and is sick dealing with what may very well be coronavirus. Now statisically, U.S. minorities (black people in particular, which I happen to be,) don't really trust the medical system here. For reasons why just look up the wealth of research done on how fucked up and biased the medical system is towards white people (particularly white men). Because of this mistrust in the system, a mistrust that- although dangerous and possibly deadly, exists for a very good reason, she refuses to go get tested and is in self-isolation. Sister 2 is also out of a job but she had saved a little bit to fall back on, unlike sister 1. That won't last too long but should keep her well for at least a couple months. But he'd situation has been clouding my mind for a while.

My older brother kept working during the pandemic at his job, which was allowed to stay open but did not protect its employees. They've had 18 cases and one death now. He's immunocompromised due to a previous health condition about a decade ago. He's in self isolation in his house too. His job has finally closed down after that death came out. I now have this on my mind. He now has no form of income as well. Both him and sister 1 will have to file for unemployment but it takes a while for that paperwork to process and that first check to come in.

My last older sister is pregnant and single, and her job as a sex worker in a different country really does not help with both the coronavirus epidemic nor the pregnant situation. I also have this constantly bombarding my mind.

My younger brother is on the verge of staying back so I will also have to begin tutoring him. He's always had issues focusing in school and now that he's gone full online he's having even more issues focusing. I'm also currently funding all of the groceries for my parents home right now so my savings are depleting fast. Another thing on my mind.

Finally, I'm also back in the dysfunctional low income household that I was raised in, where arguments about what bills to skip occur on a weekly basis.

I know many other low income kids in my neighborhood, and they have just as many things weighing their mind. The best thing about campus for me wasn't the resources or any of that, it was the distraction to focus and now that I'm back in the hellhole that is poverty I'm back to having things on my mind that outweigh school in priority. It's not a matter of whether I could keep my grades, I'm pretty confidant I could despite all this, but it would destroy my mental health. I was hoping for universal S/U not because I'm lazy or I'm a C student as many people seem to categorize, but because when I do eventually apply for graduate school, I don't want a lingering question of whether my rejection was for my application in whole or my S/U semester from a school where it was optional. I already deal with the lingering question of whether I was admitted to Cornell because I'm a minority, a question that eats at my confidence despite my accomplishments. There's already studies that show black minorities in particular face significant performance reducing mental strain in higher education because of a desire to combat stereotypes and whether they belong in the place they were admitted (read Thin Ice by Claude Steele for more info). Of course on top of all of this I have the more universal issues of self-esteem, body image, etc. Anyways, no matter what universities say it's really hard to make my brain believe that there will be no penalty to a s/u semester, but I also refuse to break myself for school when I need to be at top for my family to get through this.

So yeah, I'm probably gonna S/U all my classes. Just like most people my reasons for wanting my grading system of choice were inherently selfish on some level, but it's what I supported as people with situations worst than this definitely exist at Cornell and I don't think it's fair for you to make them decide on whether to go against what their brain is telling them and impact their own future or to go for the grade and take all the mental strain that comes with it. Here's hoping the people with even worst situations get through all this unscathed.

Because of that, we had some medical debt which at the time seemed negligible and now is a lot more burdensome. And now both my parents have lost their jobs -- so we are all now working at Amazon just to survive. Now I'm having to balance working at a wearhouse (even though I have moderate asthma and am high risk for covid 19), taking care of my nonverbal brother who needs constant attention and doing school. It's already been a shit year due me always worrying about my brother and now it's worse.

33,fxvy4x,OrganizeAndAdvocate,332.0,0.98,6,Cornell,"I’m a PhD student teaching an FWS (throwaway account). I’ve seen a lot of posts and comments about professors increasing the workload and not being accommodating to students’ needs during this crisis. I want you to know that your anger is completely justified and that this is absolutely not ok.

We as teachers/profs have received very strong guidelines about how to conduct the rest of the semester. We are required to be accommodating and very strongly encouraged to rework our syllabus and reduce the workload. I have personally cut the workload for my FWS significantly and I think all professors should do so. *Increasing* the workload is ludicrous and explicitly goes against Cornell’s guidelines.

I highly encourage undergraduates to organize and advocate for yourselves. In classes where professors are doing this, don’t just post on Reddit or complain to your friends. Advocate for yourselves. But be cautious about doing it alone: individual emails can single you out and expose you to possible backlash. Talk to other students. Collect and compile your complaints. Submit them to the professor, anonymously if necessary. And if your professor refuses to change, then take it to your department or your dean. I think they will put significant pressure on professors who are doing this. Change can and will happen if you organize.

If you do this, you might also want to reach out to Cornell Graduate Students United. As grad students we have our own major problems to deal with right now, but I think you would find support from us.

Good luck. Take care of yourselves and each other.

That morning I had no idea that my life and my career were about to change...I was certainly not ready to be inspired, and didn't expect that the professor standing in front of the class will end up changing my life, and become a life long friend and mentor. Tom and I became friends, he taught me Orgo 1, Orgo 2, Biochemistry (he taught this from a chemical perspective, years later this class would inspire my PhD work in drug design and discovery), and Toxicology...It was his Orgo 1 that inspired my change from bio to chemistry in undergrad and he inspired my career and pursuit of a PhD in Chemistry. Tom taught me how to ask questions, how to search for knowledge, and most of all how to trust my intuition in the lab. In the summer of 1999, he advised my summer research program as the Howard Hughes Research Fellow.  \nYears later, two decades later he is still my friend, he supported me through my PhD years. Endless phone calls, and hundreds and hundreds of emails, we talked about just about anything, chemistry, politics, TV shows....\n\nHe remains the only friend from my decade in the US to have visited Palestine. All I remember of that trip is endless laughter as we made our way through Taybeh, Bethlehem, Ramallah, Amman, Petra and the Dead Sea.\n\nThe last time I saw him was ten years ago in New York City, I was there for a writing workshop, and he came down from Ithaca, where he worked at Cornell. More laughter, more fun!  \nTom was an incredible photographer, but sadly since he cancelled his account on Facebook, I lost all of the photos he took of his trip to Palestine and my trip to New york.\n\nTom didn't just inspire my study in chemistry, his teaching approaches and pedagogy inhabit my own approaches and pedagogy. I taught Organic 1, 2, Advanced Organic and Bioorganic at Al Quds Bard, and I was in many ways a version of him. His technique, the metaphors used to explain organic chemistry to students were all a manifestation of his practices and his influence on me.\n\nMy favorite quote of him: We are both scientists, we both have ideas, both of our thoughts and ideas are valid, the only difference is the level of experience, so get your mind working!\n\nHe was an avid runner, and inspired my running habit that carried me through the toughest patches of my PhD work. He was also an avid cyclist.\n\nI just found out that Tom passed way suddenly yesterday at 60 years old, while cycling around town in Ithaca. He passed away doing what he loved cycling.\n\nTom was my professor, my friend, a parent when I needed one, my confidante, and someone I looked up to. The news of his death is heartbreaking...\n\nIn German the word for chemistry advisor translates to Chemical Father; Tom was my Chemical Father...Rest in Peace my friend...

44,gp4m6w,dead_passions,505.0,0.97,74,Cornell,"Hey there professors, 

I used to love the subjects and content you taught, and I used to love what you've taken the time to show me. In my time as a physics student, I've seen abstract, complex concepts hidden in the most ordinary of objects. I'm sure I don't need to explain to you the joys of discovering these things; you've all dedicated a large share of your lives to these subjects of your passion. What I'm not so sure you're aware of is this: you guys and I (I guess it's mostly me, but I don't for a moment pretend I'm solely responsible) have made this past semester a living hell for me.

I'm writing this in the wake of my PHYS 3318 final, which was due at 1:30 am. I'm writing this because I dont know where else to put it, I don't want to sleep, I'm not just here to whine and I simply don't know what to do anymore. After this last exam, the original plan was to sleep right away and be done with my semester, but instead I stayed up, sat on the living room carpet, and cried. Even though I ran out of time at the 1:30am mark I just turned in my incomplete exam and kept going until 3, I couldn't come to terms with sleeping 3 hours a day for the past two months for these classes just to demonstrate to myself in 5 hours that I've basically learned nothing. All the loss and soul sucking among of work I've gone through in the past semester culminating in half a test I've no clue how to do. I wanted there to be something I could do, but there wasn't it was over, and so I sobbed my heart out. It's not your fault and again it isn't completely mine either, but I felt robbed, robbed of my family, deprived of my health, deprived of my passion, I gave it my all and now it's all over before I had a chance to try.

During the three week break I studied nonstop until 2am to catch up and gain some mastery over my courses, and when classes started up again and 2am wasnt enough, I stayed up until 4am to get problem sets done. I rewatched lectures, took additional notes, worked examples through myself, and went to office hours. When office hours didn't work since the UTAs there were given no solutions, vetting, or training, and only gave ""yep! You're on the right track! That looks right to me!"" I stared at problem sets on my own afterward, and prayed I could finish them before the end of the week. You guys weren't making it easy either, since when I went to you professors for help all I got was the same ""great! Figure it out, interesting stuff! Don't worry you'll be fine!"" as if I'm pulling an all nighter every day and gonna be fine, when every problem is a challenge problem and is worded vaguely and the slightest misinterpretation of the problem could land me a C grade for that week's homework. All this time I'm suffocating and have to take care of my mother, who is ailing in health but is more concerned about my hospitalized grandmother and she was right to worry because in April she passed away and I remember that day we heard the news and all I remember really feeling was stress about finishing this weeks damned math and physics psets on time. As if I wasn't heartless enough of an ingrate when my mother passed away this month and I had to call the ambulance not knowing if she was going to be okay I kept thinking about the stupid curve on that prelim, how if she was hospitalized I wouldn't have enough study time, I hated myself for it then and I hate myself now. It's insane, comical even that I'm here writing about my deceased mother and grandmother like they're just points on a timeline, I remember wanting to make my mother proud but who the hell is proud of a soulless deskbound daughter anyway, not like she's around anymore to be proud or mad or disgusted anyway. This semester's turned me into something I hate, when I was crying earlier I remembered all the movies we said we'd watch together and how she would teach me to crotchet when I had time and I see what I've really ruined, all because I was so busy putting out these fires in my academics. 

I hate being melodramatic and exaggerative, but said as plainly as possible, I'm not so much angry as I am simply spent emotionally. Now that I'm at the end of the semester, I compare what I've lost to what it ended up being for, and it kills me that now I've ended up doing all this to have to choose which classes to S/U among lousy b range grades. Physics is clearly not for me, and yet I do not know what else I could do with myself. I just want it all to end. In retrospect, it was naive of me to think that Cornell is an idyllic place of learning, and that learning would come with effort. The withering cutthroat academic culture here has dug away at my passion for physics and mathematics, and I have nothing left to hold onto or be happy about. You could say I did this all to myself, but here's what infuriates me. Earlier last week, my undergraduate research PI explained to me the strict department quotas professors have for issuing grades, and how they'll do anything to create that distribution. This includes all the 15-page problem sets, those curveballs you threw right at my head on tests, all the vaguely worded challenge problems, the times you assigned an open  canvas-only notes exam, only to sneak in a few ""typos"" in key equations in the lecture notes. The questions you shrugged off one way or another, the way you mystify things, I see that your ugly side, and how you've pitted yourself against your students to produce that grade distribution. I hate that my PI pointed this out to me, it's the ugliest thing I've had to face and I still have a hard time believing the people I though my mother would be proud to see me with act with these ulterior motives. As I struggled to hold on to my sanity and family this semester, you didn't just look on. You pushed me down and held my head underwater. Well, I'm done. You win. Had I woken up to this earlier I would have tried reporting this, but you've managed to even keep me busy past course evaluations. I've spent every last shred of my will to live, act, or learn. I really hope you got your quota, and I really hope you're happy.


edit: words can't express how grateful I feel for all the support I've gotten in the past eight hours. I'm getting around to reading every dm and I feel like I'm no longer so alone. As a fairly down to earth physics girl, I never expected words from strangers to keep me going. As I've said to those of you who sent me private messages, I'm starting to gradually come up out of rock bottom, and a big part of that process is knowing I have a community who cares for me. I had zero composure while writing this post, and pouring my heart over a reddit post seemed stupid and pointless, likely to get written off as another complaining post. I only wanted to see one or two excited physics freshmen searching for physics advice here to see the struggles that Cornell really puts their students through in STEM, and expected this post to otherwise get lost in the fold of this reddit community.

To whoever gave me the platinum award, thanks a ton, but after finding out it costs money to award people on reddit, I think I should find a way to give it back. I think it should be clear I wasn't here to get ""karma"", or ""reddit gold"". Your words have been more than enough.

I want to add that after much thought and reflection I don't have any personal, hard feelings towards my professors, but rather I wanted to express the academic setup here at Cornell that has hurt so many students, but still gets accepted as almost, unavoidable, and swept under the rug, even though it is so very possible to enact change.

**I realize that I've unintentionally singled out Professor Maxson's PHYS 3318, which was not at all the central reason behind my semester of agony. Professor Maxson, if your reading this, please know that I enjoyed the fun lectures you gave us, and the contagious energy you gave to everyone in the room. It simply never matched up with the harrowing expectations in the homework and tests, which I felt I could never live up to. I hope you understand that this was the culmination of stress from all the classes in a particularly crushing semester, and I hope you understand it's nothing personal when I say I wish to remain anonymous, since I don't feel ready yet, if ever, to come forward with this. In the end, I want to thank you for reaching out. By no means was any of this anyone's fault in particular, and I hate to see you worried like this.**

**please read: I am okay, please don't call CUPD on me, those who are close to me already understand my situation and know I'm getting better.**, though I briefly contemplated suicide I never took it seriously, knowing what my mother has done to get me here to Cornell. I've removed a certain controversial line above, since I don't think it would be fair to burden my professors (who I still to some degree admire as the heroes I saw them as in high school) mentally with that kind of responsibility. I am in fairly good health, and my father has signed me up for therapy. Please don't worry about me; I wanted to delete this account, but will continue to use it, lest you guys be concerned about my kinda reckless outburst about suicide. I am faithful I'm going to get through this, though I know now **I couldn't have done it without you guys.**","[{'author': 'id0nn0man', 'body': 'i’m sorry you went through this. please don’t do anything to yourself. if you need someone to talk to, send me a message', 'score': 152, 'created_utc': 1590240630.0}, {'author': 'TheoreticallyBlank', 'body': 'I’m so sorry for what you’ve gone through, the loss of your loved ones and the toxic academic culture.

Emailed the course email and they said the reason I got a C was bc it appeared I didn’t take the final (I did) so they gave me a zero. Led to some frantic email exchanges, but the TA eventually found it stuck to the bottom of the box where the exams were kept, scored it, and told me over email my new grade. I thanked the TA but *politely* added that I should’ve been contacted to confirm if I didn’t take the exam, instead of just assigning a 0 and not telling me until I inquired. 

Professor later chimed in and took it personally. He emailed me saying he was “not obligated to change my grade”, also somehow found a way to blame me 100% for the fact that they missed finding my exam. Prof said he wasn’t gonna entertain any discussion on the topic until I came in and saw him in his office when the spring semester began. 

Kept me stressed out the entire winter break, and I feared any retaliation on my end would make him unwilling to fix my grade at all, so I sucked it up and accepted all the blame during the meeting, at which point he was satisfied and changed the grade.

Completely unnecessary and exacerbated an already terribly-low point in my life at Cornell.","[{'author': 'YaYEET111', 'body': 'Mate I would’ve gotten so pissed. Should’ve reported his ass.

48,hdvn9a,you112233,918.0,0.99,68,Cornell,"I summarized their summary with most of the bits that affect students but I would still encourage you to read the report:

**Health Monitoring**

-	Daily check in (maybe live at https://dailycheck.cornell.edu/) for COVID symptoms.
-	Possibly require flu vaccine
-	Face masks policy live: https://ehs.cornell.edu/campus-health-safety/occupational-health/covid-19/face-covering-and-mask-requirements
-	Contact tracing recommended via phone app

**Testing**

-	Low threshold for testing including those in contact with Covid-positive cases
-	“Surveillance Testing” regularly testing students and staff
-	Test students before they travel to Ithaca (remotely) and when they arrive
-	Testing students already in Ithaca and during move-in. Move-in may be 4 or 8 days to accommodate
-	Reactivation of key card and NetID requires completing a checklist

**Quarantine/Isolation/Contact Tracing**

-	Quarantine at permanent residence or Ithaca hotels, including possibly the Statler
-	“Students should be provided immunity from university disciplinary violations for activities they disclose during contact tracing”

**Modifications to Academic Activities**

-	Later start to the school year, no breaks
-	2 modes of instruction: all online, and in-person with remote access
-	Classroom capacity reduced to 13-24%
-	Wear masks in classroom, sit in assigned seats (bruh)
-	Virtual OH encouraged
-	Barton Hall or other large spaces repurposed as quiet study spaces to limit gatherings elsewhere
-	Regular grading reinstated
-	Attendance shouldn’t be counted for credit but should be taken to facilitate contact tracing
-	Recommend a stricter cap to 18 credit hours for mental health
-	Orientation should focus on behavioral expectations

**Modifications to student life**

-	Student Organizations encouraged to do virtual activities, among other considerations
-	Greek Life: “The university should develop an addendum
to the Risk Management and Social Events
Policy that requires compliance with NYS
and local public health guidelines; wearing
masks when there are visitors in the house;
registration of public health monitors for
events; coordination with SCL to ensure
vendors are healthy and safe; and
registering the addresses of chapter
annexes.”
    - “Some advocated for strict enforcement with
strong sanctions, while others caution against
risks of pushing activities “underground” where
they may be more difficult to enforce.
Greek leaders expressed desire to be involved in
enforcement of behavioral expectations and
maintain close partnership with university
leadership. “
-	“The university should suspend in-person
concerts and lectures that involve outside
guests and promote innovative approaches
to entirely new ways of socializing while
distancing.”

**Housing**

-	Eliminate quads and triples.
-	Rooms assigned to bathrooms to reduce # of people sharing
-	Lounges and kitchens remain open
-	Dining halls provide to-go service, tables properly spaced, cutlery disposable, reservations required for dine-in

**De-densification**

-	“Campus can be de-densified by inviting only
some or none of students back for
residential instruction. If this option is
pursued, the following student groups
should be given priority: new students,
including transfer students; residential
advisors; graduating seniors (especially in
the spring); athletes (if competition will take
place for their sport); and students who would not otherwise be able to maintain
academic progress without access to
campus such as students in programs that
require hands-on access to special facilities
and those who lack access to internet or
quiet learning spaces at home”
    - Comments on this suggest it is not ideal. That is to say, they are proposing this as an option but NOT saying it is what should be done. In fact, the committee recommends AGAINST doing this. 

**”Campaign for Public Health and Behavioral Influence Strategies”**

-	“Recommend a system of progressive
sanctions. Initial response would involve
just the student and be educational.
Subsequent violations would involve
parent/legal guardian, if the student has
signed a FERPA waiver. Students could lose
access to university facilities and ultimately
be referred to the Office of the Judicial
Administrator for repeated violations that
necessitate formal discipline or removal
from enrollment”","[{'author': 'pcsm12', 'body': 'Someone give this man mod status', 'score': 260, 'created_utc': 1592845094.0}, {'author': 'dr_hippie', 'body': 'legend', 'score': 150, 'created_utc': 1592844395.0}, {'author': 'Cabruh', 'body': ""Tysm for the tldr\nI wasn't ready to read 97 pages"", 'score': 100, 'created_utc': 1592846756.0}, {'author': 'antipigeons', 'body': 'lol my lack of reading comprehension could never. thank you!', 'score': 95, 'created_utc': 1592845639.0}, {'author': 'Lolli323232', 'body': 'lol no breaks...cute', 'score': 76, 'created_utc': 1592846669.0}, {'author': 'PaulyFrigginD', 'body': 'I literally need to take more than 18 credits next semester for the first time ever...they better god damn not...', 'score': 87, 'created_utc': 1592845988.0}, {'author': 'kmhk123321', 'body': 'im confused about the de-densifying part.

49,hgjrrq,im-a-little-shy,288.0,0.94,73,Cornell,"I'll preface this by saying I identify as a liberal, but sometimes I feel a little silenced by people at Cornell who kinda use the ""my way of thinking is the only right way and if you think otherwise you must be racist"" argument to cancel your opinion. The most recent place I saw this was under the Cornell Daily Sun's FB post on someone's opinion article about how the SAFC shouldn't have just decided for themselves that they could donate $10K of the student activities fees to the Cornell Students 4 Black Lives fundraiser. (Let me know if you need a link but it's not too far down their current FB page). Even though the writer's opinion was unpopular, I feel like the comments section quickly became an unsafe space for any open dialogue about the matter.

If you read the person's article, many of his points actually make a lot of sense? Like although I'm personally ok with having that money go towards the fundraiser, I understand why someone else wouldn't want that decided for them (after all this is our parents money). But I guess besides that, I think the way people have been handling conservative points of views at Cornell hasn't been the best, like accusing people of being racist just because they're in the Cornell Republicans isn't going to change their mindset. And for people like me, who wholeheartedly support the BLM movement and actively make donations to different supporting orgs, I also feel like I can't openly share my opinion without being berated for not being a good ally.

I'm sorry if this comes off offensive in any way. I'm just not sure how I feel about the tension between Cornell students right now and was wondering if other people felt this way. If I'm totally out of line, please educate me.

Edit: For context in light of all the new posts that are surfacing, I don't think the SAFC should take away the money that's already been donated to C4BL. I just think the guy who disagreed deserved a safe space to talk about the decision without being accused of racism. ","[{'author': '_whimsicalunicorns', 'body': 'I really don’t like safc in general.

A pandemic strikes and kicks us all off campus. 

The administration now does everything within its power to try to let us all come back and keep using the university’s resources while having a safe Fall 2020 semester. 

And there will STILL be people who refuse to wear a mask and refuse to stop partying. 

For the love of God, when the semester starts back up, please wear a mask and stop partying. It’ll only be for a semester (maybe two) and you can go back to it after this all clears up. 

Just imagine: if you don’t hold parties this semester, once the pandemic clears up, I bet you the post-pandemic parties will absolutely make up for the lack of partying this semester. 

Just please wear a mask and stop partying. The effort we’ve all made to be here, as well as the loans we are taking out to receive our education here, are astronomical. 

And it will all be for nothing if we get sent back home to pay 70 grand for video lectures.

Recording available at [covid.cornell.edu](https://covid.cornell.edu)

**Plans are subject to change as the pandemic evolves**

**Note:** these were the things I heard/remembered and could be slightly incorrect or misinterpreted. Official information will probably be sent out in the coming weeks

# tl;dr

* Biweekly testing opportunities starting now for off-campus students
   * See [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/hrpjr3/students_arriving_to_ithaca_during_the_summer_get/) by u/technophantom7
* Housing and dining cost reduced by 15% if leaving campus before Thanksgiving
* In-person attendance restricted to 50 students / class
* Have to tell Cornell if you are in Ithaca even if taking classes entirely online
* Assigned seats in all classes
* List of course **modalities** (in-person, hybrid, online) for all courses by end of July
   * Class times a week later, pre-enroll after that
* Two rounds of pre-enroll, limited number of credits first, remaining credits later
   * Seniority based as always
* 18 credit cap
   * Seniors can petition if needed to graduate
   * Everyone gets to petition for 1 additional ""learning opportunity"" (project team, research, etc.)
* Housing assignments **July 24**
* Move in for on campus is pretty whack see below
   * Different move-in dates depending on where you come from
   * Testing and quarantine
* A lot of programs planned for first-year students and families, see below
   * Mostly online but they want to try more in person if possible
* Online reporting tool for behavioral violations
   * Can get suspended or expelled.
* More of these coming up for specific groups/topics

**More details below**

# Tuition and Fees

* subsequent session specifically about finacial aid
* tuition will not be reduced but full need will continue to be met
* if family circumstances have changed, get in touch with finaid office
* additional emergency fund to support unexpected need

Housing and Dining rates

* **reduced by 15% for the Fall semester** due to shorter on-campus semester
* option for those who wish to remain (similar to spring), full charge for housing and dining

# Academics

3 modalities to instruction:

* In-person instruction
   * Expectation that you will be attending in person
   * In-person attendance capped at **50** students (seems like a big lecture hall could fit more but ok)
* Hybrid  - rotational model to account for constrained classroom space.
   * Alternating pattern throughout the semester
   * Students will not get to choose which rotation they attend
* Fully online instruction

You **can** take entirely online classes while living in Ithaca, but you will be expected to register your presence in Ithaca, and follow the Cornell Behavioral Compact.

Safety in the classroom

* 3000+ rooms used for academic activities, each with occupancy revised to account for 6 feet physical distancing
* HVAC systems being assessed
* **Assigned seats**
* Masks in the classroom
* Enhanced cleaning

Enrollment

* for each course, faculty and TAs decide modality
* in-person class capacities are being re-scaled (reduced) for some courses
* List of courses and modalities by **end of July**
   * Course times a week later
   * Enrollment after that
* Seniors enroll in a **limted number of credits** first, then juniors, sophomores, etc. Meant mostly for courses with in-person instruction.
   * Second round of enrollment for remaining credits
   * Goal is to preserve seniority but distribute in-person seats among students from all years.

Credit Cap

* 18 credit cap
* Considerations:
   * No breaks, many additional stress factors anticipated this semester
   * Based on mental health review, found that students who take a normal load feel inadequate when compared to their peers - trying to reduce this
* **Seniors** will be able to petition for more credits to graduate
* Petition at the college level for **1 additional learning opportunity**
   * TA job
   * Project team
   * supplemental course (AEW? unclear)
   * Research

Exams

* ""semi-final"" exams before Thanksgiving
   * In person for students on campus/in Ithaca, even if class is entirely online
   * Did not explicitly mention exams for students not in Ithaca, likely still online. 

* Most other schools in the country are doing graded - would be a bad look for grad school if Cornell didn't return to normal.

# Accommodations

Zebadiah Hall, Director of Student Disability Services

* The process to get accommodations will not be ""medicalized""
   * Medical records will not always be necessary
* Modalities are meant to allow SDS to support most vulnerable students

# Health, Safety, & Testing

Dr. Gary Koretzky, VP Academic Integration

* Ongoing public health campaign - lots of information planned
* **Asymptomatic spread is real**

The approach:

1. Mitigate viral spread - inevitable that people on campus will get it.

* Hand sanitizer stations around campus
* If inside any building aside from your dorm room, private office, required to wear a mask
* If in a group outside, need to wear a mask
* If outdoors alone, have a mask visible and ready for when you encounter someone
* Limit gatherings
* No visitors
* Discourage travel

1. Testing

* Collaboration with Cayga Medical Center
* Testing for the **presence of the virus**  (not antibodies)
* Daily self-assessment check-in with Cornell Health (didn't explain how this happens)
* Free testing
   * Started this week: bi-weekly testing clinic for **off-campus residents** \- **registration required**
   * Testing for on-campus residents **built into move-in process**
* **Get tested at home** before coming to school
* Frequent testing once the semester starts

# Residential Life & Housing

55,hvzyjh,throwaway123452165,541.0,0.97,69,Cornell,"My favorite cousin, who is 21 years old and healthy on all scales, has recently passed from complications due to a blood clot formed in her brain from the coronavirus. It was all very quick- her family did not even know she was positive when suddenly she said she couldn't move anything on her left side of her body and was rushed immediately to the ER where she died not long after. I'm still in shock and am afraid for my life everytime I leave my home.

The most unfair part about this is that she observed all the rules. She wore a mask, she tried her best to keep 6 ft from everyone and only went out to work at her job since she is an essential worker and my cousins family needs her income to live paycheck to paycheck. I just saw a post on this subreddit about someone who doesn't observe these simple rules and it PISSED me off. Idealistically, if most people observed the rules, we might have been able to flatten this curve earlier and maybe one of my favorite people on this planet wouldn't have died. I'm so angry with this world right now because it seems like people like me who are low income who HAVE to work to afford basic necessities are most at risk due to assholes like u/ascape2 who ignore precautions and asymptomatically spread the virus to us.

I also realize most people on reddit do follow the rules and wear masks and such, and so this post probably won't make much of a difference, but I hope it inspires at least one person to start following the rules. We as young healthy college students may not be the highest at-risk demographic, but we aren't immune to the virus and never know what could happen.

Our mental health experts recently ran a mathematical model which showed that such a refund will drastically reduce stress for students*. Details about this refund will be released sometime in the next 1 to 254 weeks. Unfortunately, running the previously mentioned mathematical model was very expensive, so we will also have to increase tuition by 50 cents per student. But hey, that’s just 1,999,999.50 more dollars that you need till you can get that plane!!

Warmest regards,

Martha Pollack 

*model assumes 100% of students have zero dollars to begin with, such that the $1 refund leads to an infinite increase in student wealth. Model has an uncertainty range of - infinity to + infinity.","[{'author': 'DeathsFavoriteHuman', 'body': 'I hope you get shitty hands at your bridge tournament', 'score': 103, 'created_utc': 1595936570.0}, {'author': 'Jakyland', 'body': 'Could you imagine the congestion over Ithaca airspace if everyone flew in on their private jet?', 'score': 45, 'created_utc': 1595939162.0}, {'author': 'CanadianCitizen1969', 'body': 'I laughed', 'score': 34, 'created_utc': 1595934259.0}, {'author': 'itsYaBoiMartha', 'body': 'shut up fucking imposter, how dare u', 'score': 15, 'created_utc': 1595948770.0}, {'author': 'Its3amInUpson', 'body': ""Fuck that, I'm using the reimbursement to pay for Steak on a Wednesday."", 'score': 6, 'created_utc': 1595947518.0}, {'author': 'Deborah-Z', 'body': 'legendary shitpost', 'score': 7, 'created_utc': 1596003416.0}, {'author': 'babybitchboi', 'body': 'good luck at your bridge tournament!!', 'score': 12, 'created_utc': 1595945205.0}, {'author': 'DrDankMemezPhD', 'body': 'Greetings 👽🖖', 'score': 2, 'created_utc': 1595951541.0}, {'author': 'Mage679', 'body': 'A private jet may not be a bad idea.

I am playing devil's advocate as a downstate New Yorker.  New York was in a BAD way this spring.  I am very blessed that my parents were able to work from home and no one in my immediate family got sick.  I know it made national news, but I'm telling you, it was surreal to turn on your local news everyday and see crying reporters standing outside hospitals talking to crying healthcare workers about how dire the situation is.  Seeing lines of ambulances blocks long waiting to bring people to the hospital. Having them report from outside refrigerated morgue trucks, showing what the inside of an empty one looks like and how much capacity it has.  Interviewing people who lost multiple family members to covid.  Seeing the USNS Comfort hospital ship, the Javits Center turn into a hospital and tent field hospitals set up in Central Park that looked like something out of the Civil War.   

New York was able to bend the curve by a lockdown and then strict phased re-openings that focused on the numbers of positive cases in a particular area.  This along with strict mask requirements and social distancing has put us where we are as of today, with a 1% positivity rate statewide, out of the tens of thousands tested each day.  I guess what I am saying is NY deserves to protect itself from an influx of people from states that have covid positivity rates of 20% or higher.

62,i2l28q,ruudboy2,437.0,0.97,10,Cornell,"*excuse the long winded backstory and semi rant but I really wanted to express this*

When it first started to set in that I would be going to Cornell starting in Fall 2019, I was pretty excited but a little anxious.  I came from a tiny school (like really tiny) where everyone knew everyone else and I basically had to deal with the people that were there and make the best of it.  Now, I was jumping from a school of 80 to a school of 15,000.  I’d have a wider circle of people to choose from but obviously a more intimidating and competitive environment academically.

As soon as I arrived on campus though, I felt like there couldn’t possibly have been another place for me to go. That is all because of the people in this fine institution. People in my dorm although quite different from me were always super nice and I could always pop into their rooms to talk, play games or just chill.  My student advisor, who I assumed would be quite distant from me (being a checked out senior and all), always found time to meet with me not just for academic reasons but sometimes just to hang out and get me free ice cream from Cornell Dairy.  Lab partners and people I randomly met in my nerve wracking intro classes never hesitated to help and were always super appreciative when I helped them even if it took myself little to no effort.

Finally, I can’t stress how amazing my new closest friends at Cornell have been.  Ready to uplift, fool around, be serious and really personify the type of people Ezra Cornell wanted to attend his university.

Overall, people at Cornell are amazing and I can’t stress that enough.  Rather than bicker at each other and demonize each other for our actions, we should remember that we were all chosen to be a part of a group of students with some of the best characters you can find in life and some of the most driven and motivated people in the entire world.

Can’t wait to be back on campus with all of you in a couple of weeks.  Let’s go Red 🐻 🔴⚪️.","[{'author': 'amandacarlton538', 'body': 'This was such a wholesome post to read.

63,i4jdin,None,338.0,0.95,30,Cornell,"Hey everyone. I'm a rising senior who is graduating in December. So, this is my last semester of undergrad. I'm going to explain why I've chosen to stay home and do online classes this semester, as sad and disappointed as I am. This was not an easy choice, and something I've been thinking about for weeks now. I hope this helps anyone who is still uncertain about their decision on whether to go back or not.

I've had a great three years at Cornell. I have a great group of friends. I am part of multiple clubs and am an active member of Greek life. With that being said, pre-Covid meant that I would regularly go out 2-3 nights a week. Once Covid hit, I was one of the students who opted to stay in their off-campus housing, and even continued to go out once everyone else left. Ithaca felt like a safe bubble, unaffected by the rest of the world. My real wake up call came when someone I was in mild contact with was diagnosed with Covid early April. It was shocking and frightening. My roommate and I were contacted via contact tracing and were required to quarantine in our apartment for 2 weeks. We lived in constant fear that every cough or sneeze was 'it'. Luckily, we didn't have it, but that scare was horrible.

Fast forward to the end of April when I returned home. Where I live, people were being diagnosed at that time at thousands per day. I didn't realize the extent and seriousness of this disease until then. I have pretty bad anxiety which made it so difficult for me to leave my house. Even going for a walk felt like a potential war zone. I wondered whether the jogger in front of me had Covid and if I could have gotten it from them, or the guy at the grocery store who was wearing his mask below his nose. Every outing felt, and has felt, like a huge risk.

I have friends (in Greek life and beyond) who have stayed in Ithaca during the summer. In case you guys don't have friends up there right now, I can promise you that there are parties every. single. night. Oh, and during the day. The students up there are being negligent. I have even heard stories of people 'turning' and blaming one another because there have been mild outbreaks amongst party goers in the past few weeks. It literally pains me to see some students on social media doing shots in a crowded apartment one night, and then see them return home to their families a few hours away a few days later.

'Social compact' or not, students ARE going to go out. The bars in Collegetown are going to be breeding grounds for the virus. Before Hideaway was shut down a few weeks ago (I assume for violating social distancing laws), they posted Snapchats of NO ONE wearing a mask and it was  packed. For some reason, the majority of young people truly think they are invincible to Covid. We hear of the few people we know that have had it say that it isn't worse than any other cold or flu. But a quick Google search will bring up dozens of people in their 20's who have died. Some have died of sudden strokes due to the virus. Many of these people were healthy college students, even college athletes.

I don't mean to be apocalyptic or scare anyone. This is just my thinking and I wanted to share. I want to reiterate that you are in charge of your own behavior. However, you can't fully control what your roommate does or who they see. You can't control who the person sitting next to you in class or walking in front of you down a hall does or who they see. Scientists simply don't know everything about this disease and how it spreads. If it is as airborne as they say, lecture halls and dorms may be petri dishes for the disease. The 'solution' isn't to *only* call out specific organizations or groups of people. This isn't *just* a Greek life problem. This is a student body issue that requires collective action. However, I fear that as emerging adults, our underdeveloped ways of thinking will prohibit the rational behavior needed to keep us and others safe. 

To me, the risk is NOT worth the reward. This semester's experience will not compare to the typical Cornell we all know and love. I can't imagine the constant fear of questioning whether you have come into contact with someone with Covid. Odds are, you WILL come into contact with someone with the virus and will have to quarantine. President Pollack herself said their models predict somewhere near one-thousand students getting it. The constant switching between in-person and online classes (due to hybrid schedules or forced quarantines) would personally disrupt my workflow and increase my anxiety.

It's my last semester, and to me, it's not worth the risk. If you have a safe and stable home environment, and believe you can do another round of Zoom, I personally suggest it. I can almost promise the social compact will not work, based on our own peers' behavior.

If anyone wants to talk about their own decision, feel free to PM me. Remember, this is just my own take on the situation, and I don't mean to spark a debate. Just be smart, but realize that those around you may not be making the best choices.

When the course modalities goes live you will see that it is technically a hybrid class.  While lecture will be fully online (more on that in a second), there are a few in-person sections. However, there are a lot less of these than I asked for (I have staff willing to manage more), because of issues with space on campus.  The ones that we did get will be in a large computer lab and limited to 15 people.  These sections exist largely for equity reasons -- they are for the people who do not have a computer capable of doing work in the course.  So I ask that you hold off grabbing these sections unless you really need them.

As for the course itself, sections are now twice a week instead of the historical once a week.  This is because, even in online, your section will be the primary way that you contact staff and get help.  Yes, there are still open consulting hours.  But it helps in a class this large for someone to know who you are; that is easier in sections.  There is NO extra work for this extra section.  We are just spreading out the traditional work in this course over two days to make it easier to finish work during class time as opposed to using outside, after office hours help.

My lectures, unfortunately, will be recorded and posted online.  They will be YouTube style, in small bites, and asynchronous.  We will have a scheduled, synchronous lecture time, however.  This will be a completely optional time (no attendance will be taken), as I am aware of how unfair it is to abuse the online format to ask you to do more work. During this time, I will answer all questions and do demos like a performing monkey.  Think of it as a flipped classroom where I do all the work.  

Instead of the three exams, there will be only two (how we administer them to limit cheating is still being worked on).  The brand new A7 I wrote this summer will replace the final exam.  This means that the final project has to be done alone -- not in pairs.  And it is designed with the expectation that not everyone completes it (but if everyone does complete it, there is no curve that will penalize you). You will also have more time -- well into ""finals"" week to complete it.

Concerns on Cornell Re-Opening Plans Fall 2020 

President Pollack and Provost Kotlikoff, 

We write, as a department, to express our concern about the recent decision to not provide quarantine housing, meals, and support to those students from the list of states identified on the NYS travel advisory list. We also have concerns with other aspects of the re-opening plan, which we outline below and for which we offer potential solutions. 

1. Providing quarantine housing, meals, and support was part of the original re-opening plan. The number of cases in the on-campus versus online model (the Frazier model) assumed that the arriving students from high-risk states would be quarantined and monitored to assure adherence. By no longer providing students with quarantine options and support, we can expect that some proportion of students will not quarantine effectively, resulting in an increase in the number of cases on campus and in the Ithaca community. Students will feel licensed to break the rules because they feel Cornell has violated its commitment to them to cover costs of quarantine. Thus, walking back the commitment of financial support during quarantine will contribute to lack of effective adherence due to both financial and psychological considerations. 

Some possible solutions: i) Ithaca College has asked all students from these states to remain at home until their states are removed from the list. This is a tough policy, but at least reduces the number of incoming cases based on known risk rates from high case states. ii) Another possible solution would be to provide quarantine support but bring students into campus in a staggered manner (thus allowing for quarantine capacity and waves of gateway testing). This would also mean that students could be taking online courses while in quarantine. This will provide students with an opportunity to be productive while in quarantine and greatly increase the chance of a successful start to the semester. It will also allow time for Cornell to make sure everyone is familiar with the testing system and social compact protocols. 

2. Provost Kotlikoff and VP Lombardi stated that the lack of guaranteed quarantine would affect only 1,300 students, because it impacts only students who would be living in dorms, and mostly freshmen. This assumes that students from the high-infection states who are living off campus will be able to come to Ithaca and quarantine in their apartments. We are concerned that this is not a reasonable assumption. Many students live with roommates, and some live with roommates that are from states both on/off the travel advisory list. Most of these students share bathrooms and living spaces, thus violating NYS quarantine rules. 

Some possible solutions: i) Cornell needs to provide more guidance for off- campus students as to how to effectively quarantine, and potentially provide 2 options for that student community as well. ii) These students will need help with meals, groceries, and transportation to testing. 

3. Very importantly, not providing quarantine housing, meals, and support will place an unfair economic burden on some students forcing them to make risky choices or face hardships. Students of lower socio-economic status, many of which are underrepresented or first- generation, will be disproportionately adversely affected by this policy. This policy is therefore blatantly anti-equity. Application for “hardship exemption” does not make this equitable because those students will need to justify themselves and jump through extra hoops. Many will feel that the odds are stacked against them, contributing to a sense of discrimination and/or hopelessness that harms both their relationship with the University and the collective interest in full and effective quarantining. 

Some possible solutions: i) Provide, by default, all students on financial aid with the hardship exemption, or prioritize those students without the need for application. This will reduce the stress associated with this hardship and speed up the process. ii) Provide support for students on financial aid that decide to stay in their home states, to assure they have the resources to complete online learning (including access to a personal computer and internet). 

4. As we come back together as a learning community it is important that we not only provide an academic experience but also look after our students’ mental health. Our students will be experiencing unprecedented stress and anxiety due to the effects of quarantine; the social pressures that may come from watching fellow students ignore the Behavioral Compact and social-distancing requirements; as well as possibly dealing with disease outbreaks, and deaths, on campus. Counseling services at Cornell have historically been barely adequate, at best. 

Some possible solutions: i) enhance online health services with a focus on mental health, ii) call on students to volunteer to get training in mental health counseling to serve as mental health ambassadors, be able to spread information about good mental health practices, and also importantly be able to detect signs of a student in distress, iii) create a campaign for mental health awareness at all levels of the Cornell community, provide signage, free online events, and classes. iv) Preemptively prepare counseling response teams to move into on-campus AND off- campus housing to offer both crisis counseling and guidance on appropriate responses when a student tests positive for COVID. We know there will be infections, hospitalizations, and likely deaths, thus the risk of eroding student confidence in their collective safety will be high if health counselors are absent when cases begin to emerge. 

5. The “Frazier Model” is based upon student surveys from months ago when the number of cases in the U.S. was decreasing and our confidence was increasing that we could contain the virus. This has changed, and will continue to change daily. Current national models predict that 11,000 people will die each week in the month of August in the U.S. The Cornell and Ithaca communities are very concerned with the influx of new cases, the transparency of data on new cases, and the lack of thresholds or specific criteria that would trigger actions such as a university lockdown or closure. 

Some possible solutions: i) the administration must be transparent about the number of cases and the results of testing, preferably with a frequently updated dashboard. Related to this is the degree and notification of contact tracing in the case of positive cases on campus. ii) conduct a follow up survey of the students that could include peer assessment questions to determine the extent to which students are worried about the conduct of other students. This would allow us to parameterize contact rates. Non-adherence to the behavioral compact is one of the variables that is most likely to alter the course of community disease and we believe that potential problems with student behavior could be corrected in part by providing them with real-time data connecting COVID patterns on campus with polls of student behavior and attitudes. Cornell should be prepared rather than reactive. iii) Our community needs clear criteria and parameters guiding decision-making for our response as cases increase in Ithaca. These criteria should be public. 

Thank you for considering the concerns outlined above, and our proposed actions that we believe will increase safety and equity for all in this difficult time.","[{'author': 'cornt0ss', 'body': 'Can we talk about how well-thought-out these issues are as well as the feasibility of their proposed solutions.

You should also know that **people are breaking quarantine** across campus and, if we're not lucky, community spread will occur as a result.

You should know that people in quarantine have to share bathrooms in the dorms. And some of the staff have to share bathrooms with residents in quarantine. 

You should know that most of us (not all) will be taking most of our classes online across from a roommate who is also taking classes online, won't be able to really eat meals with friends in a group, and won't have many (if any) in-person activities.

Yes, the administration is doing serious mistakes with the move-in process, and the reactivation plan is still quite uncertain, even as we edge the beginning of the semester.

Yes, the country is dealing with this pandemic quite badly.

Yes, the impacts of this pandemic can often seem distant for demographies at low-risk like ours.

And yes, quaratine, social distancing, and precautionary measures can often imply difficult choices, tensions, and loneliness. Fear of missing out, and a fear of time lost.

However, that does ***not*** exempt you from personal responsibility in the actions you take.

71,ieo7ct,None,773.0,0.98,27,Cornell,"  The year is 2037. “America” is synonymous with “Cornell.”

During the 2020-2025 COVID-19 pandemic, Cornell was the only university to succeed in reopening, a Herculean effort that bankrupted every other university in the nation. With its multi-trillion dollar endowment it accumulated from the donations of billionaires from around the world, who lauded the success of the Big Red Vaccine, Cornell bought every other university in America. 

I’m a 2036 graduate living in New York City. Today is job enrollment day. Since my enrollment window isn’t until 4:00 PM, I decided to head down to the local Nasties to pick up some buffalo wings and signature Cornell ice cream. 

As I’m waiting in line, I overhear someone talking over the phone. It’s some software engineer from my class bragging about his brand new six figure salary. He got lucky with his enrollment window. I just hope there are more CS slots left, but with my time window, I’ll be lucky to land any engineering job. 

Suddenly, I hear the familiar chime of the nationwide intercom system. It’s time for the national anthem. I immediately turn toward the nearest smiling portrait of President Martha Pollack, place my right hand over my heart, and belt out my loudest “Far above Cayuga’s waters...” The man on the phone appears to pay no attention. He’s immediately grabbed by secret CCCT agents standing in line and disappeared. 

As I stand in line trembling, I can’t help but selfishly hope that his job slot becomes available by my 4:00 enrollment window.

By the time I finish singing with a “Hail, all hail, Cornell!” I’m next in line. I make my order. “That’ll be 25.00 BRBs,” the AEP bot-cashier beeps. Since the collapse of the dollar back in ‘21, Big Red Bucks have been the official currency of the United States of Cornell. I swipe my ID card, but it gets declined. Oh no! I forgot BRBs don’t roll over month-to-month. Embarrassed, I run back to my dorm room in Low Rise 21756. 

I check the time. It’s 3:55 PM. I hop on my computer and enter my Net-ID: ab345287 and my password into Citizen Center. Before I enroll, I have time to vote in the annual presidential election. I click on the election tab, fully expecting the usual two options: Martha Pollack and Martha Pollack. But, to my surprise, I’m instead offered the options of Martha Pollack and Walker White! He must’ve hacked the election! I eagerly click on his name and submit my ballot. 

Suddenly, my internet goes out. *This must’ve been a test, and I’ve failed*, I think to myself while bracing against the back wall of my dorm room as I wait for the CCCT to bust down my door. But nothing happens. My internet comes back on. The ballot now has the two usual options. Dejected, I cast my vote for Martha Pollack and head to the enrollment page. 

It’s now 3:59. I’m watching the second hand of the clock app on my phone. Just as it strikes 12, I click “enroll.” The page buffers. A minute passes. Then another. Finally, I’m greeted with my career options. The only slots left are in the fine arts. Without a CS slot available, not even 56 years of programming experience could grant me a software engineering job. Crying, I choose to be a painter. My projected annual salary is 10,000 BRBs. I have 400,000 BRBs in student debt. Can I even pay monthly interest? 

Before I can do the math, my door explodes and I’m placed in handcuffs. “Citizen,” an officer addresses me, “with your projected annual salary of 10,000 BRBs, you will be unable to pay the annual 100,000 BRB citizen tuition. As such, you have been found in violation of Amendment 35 of the Cornell Compact. Your diploma is hereby null and void and you are to be expelled from Cornell immediately.” 

I’m sent to Canada, where I decide to enroll in the newly founded community college known as Harvard, renowned for being a refuge for Cornell rejects.","[{'author': 'esperantisto256', 'body': 'Low Rise 21756 got to me lmao', 'score': 155, 'created_utc': 1598125206.0}, {'author': 'greens_giga_chad', 'body': '“This must’ve been a test, and I’ve failed” just like real cornell', 'score': 112, 'created_utc': 1598128323.0}, {'author': 'thanksfortheavocado', 'body': '“not even 56 years of programming could save me,” me applying for cs jobs realizing nobody uses java anymore 😖', 'score': 48, 'created_utc': 1598129007.0}, {'author': 'HighOkenshieldPriest', 'body': 'Unrealistic no mention of the national religion okenshieldism, as well as not mentioning the CCCT sending cornell students being caught partying with their 3 housemates to the newly found gulag school in Siberia: Dartmouth\n\nEdit: plus one meal swipe for a top tier shitpost', 'score': 89, 'created_utc': 1598129083.0}, {'author': 'lymoosic9', 'body': 'This should turn into a novel', 'score': 70, 'created_utc': 1598126167.0}, {'author': 'ShoddyProgrammer550', 'body': 'Great 1984 parody.

These are things we talk about all the time and if it’s somehow not enough to keep you out of a fucking annex, then please consider the people who rely on Cornell for employment.

Because the fact of the matter is, a few more events by “unnamed parties” gone wrong, and literally hundreds if not thousands of people here are unemployed OVERNIGHT.  Yes UNEMPLOYED.  Without jobs, without a stream of income, a.k.a. something necessary to feed, clothe, and house oneself when one’s parents do not do so.  The people who work in the dining halls to serve you the food you eat every day, the people who clean the classroom floors where you thoughtlessly dump your Canada goose jackets (yes I’ve seen kids just throw them on the ground), the people who clean the dorm bathrooms for you, the people who do maintenance around campus.  All those people will be without jobs, at least until February, perhaps much longer if Cornell has to permanently lay people off to cover for the money they are hemorrhaging.

And it’s not just Cornell employees, its the countless small business owners, many of whom are immigrants without a backup plan, who have been staying open by the skin of their teeth betting on this semester’s success.  It’s the uber and Lyft drivers who ferry you around town, and it’s the families of all these people.

I’m not sure if any of you have ever taken the opportunity to *really* look around during your time here, but Ithaca, New York is not a hotbed of economic opportunity by any stretch of the imagination.  There aren’t a lot of entry-level jobs floating around for these people to turn to if things go south, especially not this year.  If these people lose their income, because of you, yes YOU, there are a lot of fucking consequences.  Some of them might lose their homes, their cars, their savings.  Some might not have savings.  If they have kids, those kids might now *eat* less because of YOU.  Those kids might not get Christmas presents this year because of YOU.  Those kids might now helplessly watch their parents suffer from depression because of YOU.  Newsflash, unemployment takes a toll on the mental health Cornell students love to bitch about a hell of a lot more than prelims (see this helpful link [https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coping-with-unemployment/art-20485976](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coping-with-unemployment/art-20485976)).

I’m not sure if you’ve noticed, but a lot of our dining hall employees are not young people, and if they lose these jobs, not only will their retirement saving stop, but they may need to dip into those savings to support themselves, delaying their retirement indefinitely because YOU couldn’t follow the rules.  These people are a part of our community just as much as any student is. I’ll fucking die on that hill.  Most of them will be here or have been here longer than any of us, and they will be working here after we’re gone.  They are definitely more so a part of Cornell than certain unnamed fucking frosh who have already busted in here like they own the place.

You interact with them on a daily basis, you recognize them, they make everything run, they work incredibly hard, they smile and give you words of encouragement and fucking feed you.  If the campus shuts down, they do not go back to Westchester or Long Island or Miami or Manhattan.  You are indebted to them, you owe it to them to do everything you can to keep this semester alive.

What is a bummer of a semester for you, has potentially ENORMOUS implications for the lives of our staff here, and the college town community as a whole.  How dare you. How dare any of you forget about what is at stake for them this Fall.

Although I am based in Ithaca, all of my classes are online this semester. This is by design. 


Taking online classes, I find I have more time for myself. Not having to travel class to class, being able to catch up on my own time if I miss a lecture, being able to fast forward or rewind as many times as I like without judgment if a professor straight up made no fucking sense-- it's good for me. 


With this newfound freedom, I had the chance to organize myself. For the first time in years, I have routines. And they're healthy ones. 


With this extra time, especially during last spring, I was able to reflect on what really mattered to me. I assessed my life, and what I wanted out of it. Was I happy where I was? No. How was I going to address that?


Last spring, I started seeing a therapist. This summer, I started taking antidepressants. For the first time in my life, I've actually started studying for classes-- I passed a class I would have otherwise failed because of this.


 I work out 45+ minutes a day. I wake up at 7 AM and go to sleep around midnight. I've started reading and drawing again.


I have rediscovered lost passions. My highschool harped on passion and purpose, and I felt like I never really understood. Like I failed highschool because I didnt figure those things out for myself. But now? I understand myself so much better than I ever have before.


I'm in regular contact with the people I care about. I dress well, and my place is clean. I eat surprisingly well. I am altogether much kinder to myself, and am managing my depression and anxiety. I am the closest I've been to happy in a long, long time. 


And I can say for certain that I would not be in this position if I had to attend classes in person. Honestly, I could fail most of my classes this semester, and I dont think it would make me upset. Because I have such serenity in my life and clarity of my mind right now, and that matters so much more to me. My life is more than my performance in class. My life is holistic, and for the first time in a long time, I have the room to pay attention to those other parts of my life that have gone neglected. I feel more complete. I feel like a person.","[{'author': 'otheraccount725', 'body': 'So happy for this ray of sunshine of a post.

But this post is not for you, it is a warning to low income students come Spring, especially those who think that Cornell will reevaluate their aid after accepting their offers.

Don't get me wrong, I feel like I've grown literal superpowers in CS after taking some of the interesting courses here like 2112, 3110, and now 4820, but the fact of the matter is that I had to spend my first year quite literally starving because Cornell refused to adjust the parental contribution based on my noncustodials income from 2 years ago (and he has long since been unemployed -- and my aid appeals have long been repeatedly ignored on ridiculous stinginess of the FA office). 

Out of the advice of the ever all-knowing, low-income student-loving FA office (an excuse to not grant my aid appeal), I stayed home in this sh*thole neighborhood with my mother, only for them to take out the cost of housing out of my PELL GRANT and Cornell Grant.

Nevermind my own personal experiences with FA, the student atmosphere here regarding poor kids is the fucking worst. Meeting people and them having a conversation about how they hate that other kids get financial aid is awkward and will make you feel guilty. Them asking you why your room isn't embezzled in decorations and supplies (printers, coffee machines, etc) when the real answer is that you couldn't justify spending that money fucking hurts. 

In the end, I do still think going to Cornell is a net positive -- by a long shot.

Many of us have lived in our little bubbles our whole lives and have a hard time imagining just how hard things can be for students who don’t have the privilege of a parental income capable of paying for the high price tag of a Cornell education.

recently i’ve been going through a lot of personal shit. my long term relationship ended, my family and i are on rough terms, my grades aren’t that good, etc. it’s been an extremely rough time for me emotionally and psychologically. i spent a lot of time in bed, not wanting to do a single piece of work, just staring at the ceiling. i even considered taking a leave of absence just to get away from school and hopefully work on myself. i felt like my efforts to secure things for myself were fruitless and i was failing to be happy ever since the semester started. 

but today was different. after being pretty much the saddest i’ve been (coupled with the very cloudy and sad ithaca sky the past two days), today the sun was shining. the weather was so nice and i took a walk to central campus. i reflected on a lot of the shit that’s been going against me and even sat on the slope to enjoy the weather. i called my parents for the first time in a while. then i came home to my messy room (which was like that because of the actual depressive state i am/was in) and i decided to clean it. i reorganized my shelves and clothes. i got back an actually alright prelim grade. i bought some things for myself on amazon that i was putting off from buying because i didn’t know if they would make me happy. hell, i probably thought i didn’t deserve to be happy. i even have a date coming up this week too!

my point is, i was at one of the lowest points of my life recently. but today things really seemed to point in the direction that i wanted. and i’ve been seeing some posts of people being really disheartened about prelims and this online semester in general. although i’m not completely better right now, i think today was a great first step. please, everyone who feels disheartened because of the circumstances, stay strong. i believe your Good Day is coming. you just have to hold on until then. reach out to your trusted ones and talk to them. your Good Day is coming.

Even when I used all of my slip days the first week of school due to a major health scare (not covid), he told me to take as many as I need. 

Afterwards, when I realized that this health issue might be long term, he was the one who encouraged me to go to SDS about my health issues and to get a letter asking for accommodations. Even more, he has a no questions asked policy about extensions and when I went to office hours, reminded me that I need to calculate days for all of the other classes I missed and to make up their work. He reminded me that it's important to prioritize sleep and well, my sanity.

It's really touching to see all of your love and support for Fumi and Cafe Pacific. An alumna, Karen Perez ('19), has created a [Gofundme](https://gf.me/u/y6z8vi). Please consider donating if you aren't in the Ithaca area. Together we can save Cafe Pacific! 

Fumi (the owner) has approved of the fundraiser. 

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Cafe Pacific is Collegetown’s best kept secret. But sadly, the owner is considering shutting down the business. She told me she was barely able to survive this past summer, given how empty Ithaca was, and that this school year hasn’t brought as much business as she expected. She’s been there for over 10 years, and I’d hate to see her run out of business because of COVID.

For those of you who don’t know, Cafe Pacific is located across the street from Mango Mango and serves a variety of Japanese comfort dishes, desserts, and boba. The food is always delicious and the prices are fair. But above all, the owner is honestly one of the kindest people I’ve ever met. She always makes an effort to talk to her customers and takes random acts of kindness to the next level. For example, when I ate there yesterday, she brought me and my friends an assortment of free cakes after discovering it was one of our birthdays!

Yes, the atmosphere is a little dingy, and the wait times can sometimes be a little excessive. But she essentially runs the whole restaurant on her own. She dedicates her life to serving this community. I say it's time to return the favor. So let's help her out during these trying times!

Here's some additional info about Cafe Pacific if you’re thinking about going:

* They deliver on [ithacatogo](https://www.ithacatogo.com/restaurants?collapsable=1)
* Also can order online through [paywithway](https://paywithway.com)
* They’re open 2PM-12AM, Sunday-Thursday and 2PM-1 AM, Friday-Saturday
* Consider paying with cash! Cash is always better for small businesses because credit card fees = :(","[{'author': 'None', 'body': 'I’m working at Cafe Pacific on Fridays and Saturdays (6:00 to 9:00) as a cashier. Wait times should be (slightly) faster but if a lot of people order at once it might be a bit tricky. \n\nIf you want to order online, please call us directly for pickup if you can (607-277-7700). It’s better for us that way since we get more money on our end.\n\nSeating inside is actually a bit hard on us. Technically the government health department or whoever said that we can’t host people in there (I’ve asked Fumi if it’s okay with social distancing but she’s adamant about only having one or two parties there).\n\nFor those asking, the best thing to buy is bubble tea or snacks from the counter, since it’s quick and easy for us to make.

A few days ago, I was waiting at the bus stop of one of the off-campus apartments around West when this guy who was wearing a Cornell shirt approached me and acted like he knew me. At first I thought maybe it was someone I knew but didn't recognize because of the mask and because he just casually said ""Hey, how are you doing?"", but it soon became clear that he wasn't someone I knew and when I ignored him, he just left the bus stop the way he came, which struck me as really odd.

Then today, my friend was on the bus and the same guy got on a stop after, and started acting like he knew her. She was super nice, unfortunately, and he ended up forcing her to give him her number and touching her earrings and making her incredibly uncomfortable and she had no idea what to do. He then proceeded to hug her as he got off the bus, which made her even more uncomfortable, and now she's afraid because he has her contact information and he's a student. Once I heard her story, I knew this wasn't a coincidence and we were both incredibly creeped out.

Neither of us were sure what to do, or if we could even report this anywhere since he didn't *technically* do anything, so I thought this was the best place to put this information in the hopes that anyone who sees this knows to be careful!

Edit: I’ve been DMed by so many people thank you guys for your support! After hearing all of your stories about being touched without consent, some of which were absolutely awful, my friend and I plan to file a harassment report!

Edit 2: thank you u/ithacaisbears for linking the place to file a report! Here it is for anyone who can’t find it: https://cm.maxient.com/reportingform.php?CornellUniv&layout_id=6

Edit 3: Hey guys! So, quick update, my friend and I filed a Title IX report and a police report and got some contact info from a few girls willing to come forward. If you are someone who did, thank you so so much for doing so, you are literally amazing. In case anyone else wants to, feel free to PM me with details! I hope this man gets brought to justice, and I’m really proud of everyone for bringing awareness to his actions and expressing your support.

I was not paying much attention to my surroundings, but then all of a sudden I saw this individual (I\'m positive it\'s the same guy) emerge from the LITTLE GIRL\'S CLOTHING SECTION and make a beeline toward me. I tried to ignore him at first, and, like the original post, he acted like he knew me at first and I thought that I had just not recognized him.

""Well you are looking very beautiful today."" At this point, I was visibly uncomfortable and he was well within the 6 foot bubble.

We were in separate aisles, so I was isolated but she was only a few feet away and was able to see the majority of the interaction. I bent down to look at something, and then when I stood up he was in my aisle right beside me. He greeted me exactly the same way as before, with a familiar ""Hey, how are you"" but still proceeded to ask me my name despite our previous interaction.

I was freaked out at this point and my roommate rescued me by entering the aisle with the cart and I said a quick goodbye as we started to walk toward the grocery section. I glanced behind me as we walked and he was following us into the store. We ducked into the tampon aisle hoping that he would not follow, and he did not. I thought it was safe, so I broke off from my roommate and went to grab something from another aisle. As I was choosing a product, he approached me again in the same aisle, and started his whole script anew.

107,jt7h2j,cornellthrow878,507.0,0.98,28,Cornell,"Cornell's administration is currently in the process of totally overhauling the Student Code of Conduct. These changes will fundamentally alter your rights if you are ever accused of violating the Code of Conduct.

The rights we will lose:

1. Cross-examination (in almost all circumstances)
2. Right to a public hearing
3. The ""clear and convincing evidence"" burden of proof
4. Participation of independent counselors

The Administration is justifying these changes under the guise of making the code ""less legalistic"" and ""less adversarial"". When pressed on this, representatives defended their claims by stating ""lawyers are frightening"" and through vague statements about it ""being in the interest of the community"".

Changing the the burden of proof from ""clear and convincing evidence"" to ""preponderance of the evidence"" makes it significantly more likely innocent students are found in violation of the Code of Conduct. ""Preponderance of the evidence"" is best explained as ""more likely than not"", or a 51% chance you are guilty. Because the University only requires a 3/5 majority to find a student responsible, the addition of ""preponderance of the evidence"" means that only 3 out of 5 members of the Hearing Board need to be 51% sure that you committed the violation you are accused of. This is incredibly dangerous.

If you want to read more about the changes you can read the new code here: [https://assembly.cornell.edu/get-involved/input-issues/fall-2020-proposed-amendments-campus-code-conduct](https://assembly.cornell.edu/get-involved/input-issues/fall-2020-proposed-amendments-campus-code-conduct)

My department had a disgusting amount of academic integrity violations last semester and my peers have said they had similar issues in their departments. Faculty were required to pick either an in-person semifinal or an end-of-year final, so the total of culminating exams should not have increased. \n\nScheduling of weekend exams is due to classroom assignments. There is not enough COVID-19 capacity classroom space to run exams on just Tuesdays and Thursdays as is the typical procedure. I've heard rumblings that the extra exam day may move from Sunday to Friday next semester. \n\nI can't begin to explain how huge a process creating rosters has been. Here is my effort to provide transparecy - \n\nFall semester:\n\n* David Shmoys and team built an algorithm tracing classroom use.\n* Departments were given a budget of how many minutes of class could be held in rooms of designated sizes each week.\n* Departments had to create coflict matrixes of every class each of their classes could not conflict with.\n* Faculty had to designate whether they wished to teach in person or online, whether any (and how many) associated discussion and lab sections would be in person or online, the time frames in which they would be able/willing to teach, whether or not they would hold an in-person semifinal...\n* In-person classes were scheduled by the university architect to maximize room use and avoid class meeting conflicts.\n* All online meetings had to be manually scheduled by department point people in accordance with faculty feedback and to avoid forbidden meeting conflicts. Because historical meeting times were changed to maximize class space, this was literally rebuiliding the schedule from the ground up and required cooperation between multiple groups of departments. This process was completely new for everyone involved.\n* Classrooms were assigned and many classes moved online because the optimized room placement did not suit their needs.\n\n\\*All of this started much later than I would have expected. I'm assuming timing had to do with building and testing the algorithm to see what would be possible. \n\nSpring semester:\n\n* Largely moved away from spreadsheets and data dumps and started with standard class plans in Peoplesoft like a typical semester. Much more control was returned to the departments and many are running something close to their normal spring schedule.\n* Lots of cleanup regarding teaching modes.\n* Submission of all classes with requested meeting times and classroom capacities (or online caps) which was completed this past Friday (13th).\n* Shmoys and team will run the data to determine if in-person classroom requests can be accommodated as requested or if additional adjustments will be required. This is happening right now.\n* More cleanup.\n* Rosters will be released - planned for the week after Thanksgiving.\n* Pre-enrollment - hopefully before the end of the semester.\n* Classrooms will be assigned for in-person meetings - we may run into the same situation where classes move online because assigned classrooms don't fit instructors' needs.\n* Add/drop\n\n\\*This started as soon as the drop period ended - the first opportunity most department registrars would have to work on it.

the people arguing in favour of this just seem like misguided 'activists' who are either parroting what they hear on the internet without really thinking about it, or just looking for clout.

instead, we are just throwing the CUPD, who seem to be good, apolitical public servants, into the maelstrom of national identity politics for no good reason, and you know what this is going to do? it's going to make the police feel like it's ""us vs. them"". and then we will end up with the *exact* problem that these 'activists' claim they are trying to solve, and *any* sort of reform, legitimate or not, will become impossible.

if there is information that i'm missing, then please drop it in the comments. but on its face, this movement seems extremely ill-conceived.

122,koj6qu,CornellSimp,349.0,0.98,17,Cornell,"As we move into the New year I think it's important that students with low income that plan to work jobs on and off campus understand that trying to work and go to classes and exams during this time is an absolute nightmare.

1. Sunday exams, not only does that destroy any chance you get to work on weekends because you have to study both Saturday and Sunday but that completely destroys any mental break any you can possibly get during this time. You get out of class Friday, study and exam all weekend, and have to turn around Monday and start classes over again. God forbid you can only work weekends because I guess you won't be making any money during this time. This happened 3 weeks in a row.
2. Professors not caring. While there are many professors that will say they will help you, they won't. Try and explain that work stopped you from completing an assignment or that you were struggling to make ends meet and watch that zero fly into canvas, I promise you it's the best feeling in the world.
3. Other students expecting you to just drop everything for a group project or something and completely not respecting your time. I can't tell you how many times I have had a shift go overtime and I am late to a group meeting or something only to be shredded in peer evaluation and being called ""lazy and unproductive"" when you are busting your butt to do your share of work and also balance your entire other life.

Cornell has to do better about providing avenues and support for low-income students during this time cause it honestly feels like we're alone out here sometimes.","[{'author': 'chemicyn', 'body': 'I’ve seen nothing official, but I highly doubt weekend prelims will be a thing in the spring.

123,kp5tvq,archer_v,404.0,0.99,27,Cornell,"It’s been about 10 years since I graduated, and I just wanted to share some thoughts with those of you who are still “in the trenches” because there are definitely lessons that I’ve learned in the past decade that I wished somebody had told me when I was still in college. I hope it’s helpful to someone out there. :)

**5 things I wished I’d known as an undergrad (in no particular order):**

- Treasure all those you meet at Cornell. You never know who will step back into your life later on. One of my closest friends in the world today was in fact someone whom I wasn’t particularly close to at Cornell. More just a friend of a friend. After one encounter sometime after graduation, and despite the fact that we’ve never lived on the same continent after Cornell, we’ve since gone diving in the Pacific Ocean and in Asia, gone safari camping in Namibia, and seen the northern lights near the Arctic Circle together. She was also a bridesmaid at my wedding. Treasure those Big Red connections because amazing things can often come of them.

- It’s ok to not to have your life figured out just yet, or even 6 or 7 years out of college. When I was an undergrad, I thought I’d have things “figured out” by 25 or 26 at the latest (ie. what I wanted to do with my life). Well, it didn’t happen; in fact, I was feeling more lost than I was in college and definitely feeling a bit like a failure (imposter syndrome ramped up big time)! 
In the end, I only got to the point of being truly comfortable with my direction in life at around 31 or 32. Which probably sounds crazy and if I had heard this from my future self back when I was a college student, I think I would have balked. But everyone’s life takes a different course so don’t panic if you still haven’t figured things out by your mid-20s. What matters is that you keep trucking and keep trying different things until you’ve hit your stride. Every step is progress, even when occasionally it feels like you’ve slipped backwards going up a hill. That’s ok. As Cornellians, we’re well trained in the art of going up a hill. Don’t lose that skill even after you leave. 

- Work hard for a good GPA but know that it becomes an inconsequential part of your resume way sooner than you’d think. In my case, working in the financial sector, it stopped being relevant after my second job, because what matters after that are the skills and experience you build up on the job, and any job you get after that will likely depend more on what you make of the connections you've built through your jobs. The interviews beyond those first few roles start to involve work proper; no one’s scrutinising your GPA. So no matter how awful you’re feeling about that test or grade or or course right now, remember that it matters way less in real life so don’t sweat over it too much.

- A job that pays you well and a job that feeds you well can sometimes be two separate things. Jobs that pay well could also demand a lot of you and require massive adjustments to your lifestyle or personality that you don’t want to make long-term. Some jobs really can be soul-sucking or starve you of other things (friendship, a love life, etc.); in my former line of work, I’d seen more than my fair share of people who were financially wealthy but spiritually poor. They were not happy with life, and it showed.
Of course, if you’re the type that doesn’t mind prioritising a well paying job above all else, great. Go for it if you want. But if not, find a job that matches not only your skill set but also your personality/intended lifestyle. You’ll go further and be way, way happier that way.

- When faced with a choice to either be sensible or to do something wild, pick the thing that’ll give you some great memories. As a college student, one of the biggest luxuries you have is time - long stretches of it. I had an opportunity in my senior year and I said, “Screw it. Let’s go with the crazy option.” It took me to Antarctica and turned out to be the trip that changed my life. On that note, travel outside of your country more once this pandemic’s under control. The world is a massive, amazing place and it can really stretch your horizons.

That was the abbreviated version but clearly still ended up being pretty long.

I think this is much more common outside the US, where if you ask someone ""what do you do?"" they respond with their interests and hobbies instead of their occupation.

We separated out into sectors and pitched stocks for each of our respective sectors, then used member-contributed money to act on investment theses. We had a contract stating that this was the purpose of the funds given to the club by each member. We were expecting the contributed money to be reimbursed back when the member graduated or left the club.

The club investment manager went rogue from our investment theses and much of the club money into options INSTEAD of the stocks we worked hard to pitch. The $20,000 contributed capital by the members because of this manager is now worth $800. So, fiscal irresponsibility from the manager right there. Then, the club head had the audacity to say that I would be responsible for trying to be reimbursed my principal that was improperly allocated— with the only avenue of punishment that he exercised was kicking this manager from the club. I would have to pursue the kicked manager  to get my principal back that he violated the financial allocation agreement for. The club head can’t get in contact with him at all because the former manager isn’t responding to emails. Fuck this club.

First, we received a total of one lab handout back before the last one was due. Please correct me if I’m in the minority, but I rely on feedback on past work to improve my future work. This class has completely failed to give us the tools we need to improve on our work.

Second, lecture consistently ran late and I had to leave early in order to make it to my next class (where attendance was taken) on time. While this might not seem like a big deal, I definitely missed important details due to the professor’s complete inattention to the time.

Third, the professor failed to prepare us for tests, particularly the semifinal. We received a topic list for the test at 11:59 PM the night before a 9:30AM exam.

Fourth, the professor failed to observe the required semi-final and final exam periods. We had homework due during both, including a homework due the day before the semifinal. Classes that had a semifinal were prohibited from assigning homework during the study periods.

Fifth, we still haven’t received grades (they’re currently listed as “NGR”). Grades were due to the registrar last Friday.

Thinking of how many people go through something similar in their first few months of college breaks my heart. In hindsight, I’m so grateful to the frat brothers who made me feel unwelcome at their rush events, because I don’t know that I would even recognize myself if I had gone down that path. 

Obviously we still don’t know the full story, but it seems most likely that Antonio took a wrong turn on his way back to North - I just can’t imagine he went there on purpose. I didn’t even know about that little spot overlooking the gorge until junior year. But to be stumbling through the dark, alone in a new town, with nobody looking after him after pressuring him to drink so much, makes me sick. I would physically assault any of the brothers who did that to one of my friends.

I seriously question anyone who can remain involved with Greek life after this. The network, the social life - none of it can possibly be worth contributing to an institution reliant on classism, racism, sexism, and transphobia. A supremacist institution, at its core. To me, it seems the best way to honor his memory is to abolish the system that put him on a path to death before he even set foot on campus.

The idea that the people he saw on that night, people whom he just wanted to be friends with - to find a community with, like all of us did when we first got here - would lie to his devastated parents and deny them closure... There’s no reforming that. The incentives created by that institution run directly in opposition to who we should aspire to be as students of one of the most elite schools in the country. 

Rest in peace, Antonio. Know that your life meant something to those of us outside of the fraternity’s closed doors.

For those out of the loop, 8 people were killed in an apparent mass shooting targeting Asians on Tuesday night. To many, this may seem like an isolated incident. But for many Asian Americans, these killings are only one event in a string Asian hate crimes that are surging around our country. The Asian students at Cornell deserve to know that their university cares and is willing to take action to protect them during a period of historic and unprecedented anti-Asian sentiment, racism, and violence. We need to know that we are safe walking the streets of our campus. I know both friends and family who are scared to leave their homes tonight. Many will dismiss this statement as an overreaction, but for those who are being targeted, we are only too used this type of news being swept under the rug. And now, because our experiences and stories have failed to gain traction, we are suffering in silence. But this time, it feels different, this incident is on the front page of The NY Times; it feels like a possible watershed moment, so I have decided to speak out. We aren’t asking you to pity us. We just want you to listen, to pay attention and acknowledge our worries and fears. We want to know that we matter. We are crying for help, just hoping that are pleas are not falling on deaf ears.

This is not how you live respectfully with others. This shows a lack of respect for the building staff and for the people sharing these living spaces with you. Your dorm is not a pig pen, so please stop acting like it is. If you spill something, sweep/clean it up! If you shed hair during a shower, pick up the much you can! Find a reusable bag that you can use to carry your dining hall food (instead of juggling 10 things in your hands and walking away when you inevitably drop your food). Use Laundryview's text feature so you're reminded when your laundry is done. All this and more will make your dorm a much cleaner place.

You were sitting there alone outside of CTB, manspreading all over a chair. You were on the phone with someone and you didn’t even bother to put your phone down or hang up before you yelled at me.  When you shouted, “HEY!” I looked at you because it was startling but I didn’t think you were talking to me. But when you said, “Jiggle-tits! It’s like the ‘70’s!” I knew you were talking to me. When you yelled that at me, people didn’t look at you. They looked at me. And I kept walking, stayed silent, crossed my arms over my chest, and tried to ignore everyone’s stares. 

I refuse to be embarrassed for deciding not to wear a bra this morning because I find them uncomfortable, for wearing a tshirt because it’s finally warm outside and it was one of the only clean shirts I had, for having the body I have. But I will let myself feel embarrassed that I didn’t do anything. I have excuses, but that doesn’t change the fact that I wish I had done something in that moment. Something to change the fact that I left that encounter feeling embarrassed and silent and trying to become smaller and hide while you laughed and went back to your phone call and coffee. 

I don’t know what I should have done in that moment, so this is my way of trying to make myself feel like I’m doing something about it now and not just staying silent and trying to be smaller in the face of your words.

They also said that they’ve talked to him before and he has some mental health issues and he has told them that he doesn’t mean to do what he does.

I know it is a stressful time and it is crucial to seek help. But please be CAREFUL when reaching out to Cornell Health or Cayuga Medical Center.

Last week I called Cornell Health for help due to a post-assault trauma but they kept asking me COVID questions and later sent a MALE Cornell Police to look for me even though I repeatedly told them I was was safe and I was in a lecture. The male officer was so rude on the phone so I asked to speak to a woman.

A female police officer later helped me book a therapy session (two days from then) and asked me if I want “immediate help”, I thought it was a short walk-in therapy session that I could go home in 1 hr, so I agreed. But I was sent to Cayuga Medical Center.

At Cayuga Medical Center, they took away all my personal belongings (including my phone) and let a MALE nurse question me on details of my sexual assault. I asked to speak to a woman or have a woman presented. He and another female professional refused by saying that they didn't have enough staff and they didn’t understand why I was so upset. I asked to leave, call a friend, call a police, or call a lawyer, which they all refused. It was then that I was triggered and cried so loud that entire floor could hear so they finally assigned me a female nurse. They performed physical examination and mental evaluation on me, but didn't tell me that I won't get result till midnight and I might be hospitalized up to 15 days. When I was waiting, I was so hungry and lonely (no food, drink, phone, laptop, no one talked to me). I asked for help but nobody responded. I cried, and a female professional (who previously said she didn't understand why I was upset) came to say ""we have other patients, can you stop screaming?"" I said I was not screaming, I was just crying. She said ""can you quiet down?""

At midnight, they told me that I need hospitalization. They refused me to call a lawyer or the police. I begged at least can I text a crisis manager so he could ask my professors for academic accommodation when I was hospitalized. The nurse: ""oh so now you are comfortable talking to a man?"" I didn't know what to say. The crisis manager happened to be a man and what I could do?

&#x200B;

When I was hospitalized, they gave me a form to fill in what are my triggers. I wrote ""men."" And later they sent a male staff to check on me every 15 minutes. They didn't inform me their 15-minutes policy until the second time the staff opened my door and I said ""it is kinda creepy."" At about 3am, my room was so cold that I couldn't sleep, so I stayed awake. At 4am, another man opened my door and attempted to come in, but saw me awake. I said ""yes?"", he looked at me and left without saying a word. I felt it was weird so I went out to the front desk, and found that HE WAS ANOTHER PATIENT, NOT A STAFF. I told the nurse about it, the nurse responded that ""he had no reason to come to your side of the hallway, but he was not dangerous, he was JUST forgetful.""

&#x200B;

I couldn't sleep afterwards and I constantly heard other men talking, laughing in the hallway and even knocking my door. I felt very triggered and scared, but the nurse won't allow me to leave my room or send a staff to talk to me.

&#x200B;

In the late morning, a psychiatrist came to talk to me and after 10 minutes she decided that I was safe to go out and decided to discharge me on the same day. In the afternoon, I was allowed to go out in the common area. Another male patient followed me around the common area, said offensive words to me, and called me ""coronavirus"" (I am Asian). The nurses noticed but none intervened to help me.

&#x200B;

When I was finally home, I called Cornell Health to ask if they knew what happened to me after they sent police to search for me. They said no. I asked if they could call me like around 10 times and sent police to search me, didn't they think it was necessarily to follow up and check on me afterwards so they could realize I was trapped in a hospital? They didn't respond.

&#x200B;

I also called Cornell Police to ask if they knew what happened to me. They said no. I said I felt betrayed because they made me believe it was a walk-in therapy session, and they never informed me the possibility of involuntary hospitalization. The police were very shocked, too, BECAUSE THEY ALSO THOUGHT THAT WAS A SHORT WALK-IN THERAPY SESSION. Like, they can call an ambulance to send a student to a hospital, but they don't know what the student may face, and never think about following up with the student.

============================================================

\*Updates\*:

\[4/21\] finished 6th meeting with someone in Cornell Health. NOT HELPFUL AT ALL. Their main point is that ""everything we did is within our protocol."" called law school where I can find attorneys. 

\[4/12\]

I just finished a meeting with someone in Cornell Health. I also mentioned that there are so many students had similar bad experiences as me. We were not sure if I could address those concerns in behalf of others, but she said she would refer to proper personnel to see what kind of method/platform the school could work out. She will follow up with me when she hears back. Not sure how long it takes. Honestly she is the 5th person in Cornell Health that I tried to forward my complaint but each of them would say they are not in charge of it. This is ENDLESS.

CMC also sent me an apology letter this morning (as I requested last Friday), which is far below sensible or satisfactory:

""Dear \[my name\],

I wanted to respond to your request for a formal apology regarding your experience as an inpatient at Cayuga Medical Center. I apologize that your experience was not positive and less than we would have liked or intended in the care and treatment of people in our community. As we discussed in our telephone conversations I cannot speak to your experience with Cornell Health, Cornell Police or Bangs Ambulance and I recommend you discuss your concerns directly with them. Nonetheless, I have, per your request included \[staff name\] at Cornell Health in this response. Additionally, I have relayed the concerns you shared related to your care and treatment in the Emergency Department to the leadership in that area so that they can address any personnel, policies or practices necessary to correct the issue.

As it relates to the Behavioral Services Unit, I have spoken with the staff members that cared for you. I worked with each individual to insure that the staff are responsive to the needs of all of our patients and are prepared to understand and respond to their individual needs. I am happy that the female nurse that met with you at approximately 4am was able to collaborate with you and address some of your needs at that time and that the psychiatric provider ultimately determined that you did not need to remain in the hospital.

Again, my apologies that your experience was not positive. Please know that I take every concern very seriously and work to improve the way we deliver care, sometimes in very difficult circumstances.""","[{'author': 'pressatopound98', 'body': 'I was hospitalized at Cayuga Med too, and let’s just say, it wasn’t the most fun experience.

I had fractured my finger and went to their clinic. The secretary who checked me in was very rude and they made me wait very long (over an hour). When they went to x-ray my finger, I asked the woman if I needed the covering for the rest of the body (that is supposed to be put on even for local x-rays). She insisted I didn't and I foolishly did not push for her to put it on me anyways. Then I waited for awhile again (over an hour) for the doctor to come in and he tried to fit me for a full finger cast when it was very obvious that my finger was not broken and it may have not even been a fracture (and also they didn't even confirm with the x-rays yet). When I told him that I'd prefer he look at the x-rays first he sneered and just gave me a splint but I insisted that I'd wait in the room until they confirmed it was not broken or fractured or if it was. He also told me I'd have to wait longer but at that point I didn't care because I had already waited so long. As I was waiting I heard the doctor and the staff literally complaining about my presence when I was like the only person there at the clinic that time. Also they didn't even try to be quiet, like the door in my room was closed but I could hear them. Anyways, after waiting a while and having to sit and listen to them complain about my presence, the doctor just popped in and told me he thinks it is just a contusion and said i should wear the splint for a week but then also referred me to see an orthopedic which was pretty sus since I have broken bones/have fractures before and usually you don't get referred to a specialist unless it is serious. I almost left the place and realized they never gave me records of my x-ray (which they are supposed to). I had to fight with them to give it and they made me wait very long for it. I ended up sending the x-rays to an orthopedic I know at home who told me I had a small fracture and should wear the splint for 2 weeks and that I shouldn't need to follow up on it unless it continued to hurt afterwards. To top this all off, about a few months later I got a bill for my visit and they charged over $250 to my insurance and charged me like $100.

2. I feel like every female friend I have has some gross, disturbing story of something that happened to them at Cornell, and if  they don't have that something disturbing before Cornell. If they don’t have this history then it’s my subset of friends that don’t talk to men at all (that I’m pretty sure are in the closet). 
3. I feel like our sex education or play or whatever the hell that was freshmen year was especially awful, as the perpetrator was ""ignorant."" Let's be clear! If you are at this school, I'm going to assume you're not a fucking bozo. So on that note, you simply blatantly don't give a shit about a woman's boundaries if you assault them!  If anything it's the victim in denial, not the fucking perpetrator. Give me a break lol
4. I may be overly harsh here, because I actually care about the issue and don't want to use it just to pad my resume, but I also feel like consent groups at this school do virtually nothing and they're so ineffective they hinder progress. I will actually call out Consent Ed. I do remember some weird bullshit happened on GR and they felt compelled to make a statement. Tbh, no one asked. This would not have annoyed me so much except that was the first time I had heard about them do literally anything on campus.  I've had multiple friends with really upsetting CSA histories apply to consent ed and get rejected, and I'm not even sure if they have survivors on their actual e-boards because their e-board application questions were so insensitive and stupid like ""why is consent important?"" Also heard management say really awful shit.  I've been to similar meetings for similar clubs and the entirety of the meetings are ""make sure you say partner not boyfriend"" instead of actually doing something useful and productive. It's like they're PCing themselves to death, because men commit the vast majority of sexual violence crimes on this campus. 
5. Also soooooooooooooooooooooooo many men will post stupid shit about ""support survivors"" and then continue to befriend men that are accused rapists lol. Then those men get mad at “men are trash” posts lol 
6. You also can't report assault with the rigor of this school, it's really just not fucking possible to go through the process and do well in your classes.
7. Also... can you stop going to frats that assault your friends? I know this school is social climby but if chadwick the 9th raped your friend you probably shouldn't hang out with him even if his daddy is a goldman exec just saying
8. Stop taking off the condom when you have sex with girls, without their knowledge. I don't know why it's so hard for this subset of men to see they're the problem but you're also the problem. Fucking hell. If women reported that half of you hoes would go to jail 
9. I know a lot of you are engineers and not social-sciences inclined but it would be really helpful if everyone at this school had some just really basic knowledge about psychology. I hear so many people say such stupid things or ask such stupid questions, ""How is he a rapist, he's so nice!"" Abusive men regularly make everyone they meet a character witness. Like get with it, lol. ""WhY didnT sHe ImMeDiAtEly rePorT iT."" Sexual assault victims feel shame, Robert. Like god. Stop asking people to educate you on really basic shit, and if you don't know anything, at least try to avoid commenting. Stop acting like rapists are on the outskirts of society, they're literally your peers.
   1. On that note, people see women that are overly-sexually active and destructive and a lot of you are too dumb to know that's a trauma response. So I'm telling you now. That's often a trauma response. Don't be a dick to other people.
10. A lot of ya'll are more disgusted by women who have a lot of sex than actual rapists. Women have sex and enjoy it. Jesus fucking christ, get over it.
11. Cornell Health is really weird at gyno appointments and has made many inappropriate comments to me. I never went there for a sexual assault reason but  I can guarantee they don't treat those cases well
12. Literally every frat has at least one rapist. Also, stop morphing all of your complains into ""greek life"" and not ""frats."" Not saying sororities are perfect, but we certainly don't rape people THOUGH they should do a lot more to protect all of their members than they currently do
13. I didn’t originally mention CUPD because they do so little lmao

162,ms8b3x,jimboygenius1,346.0,0.96,21,Cornell,"Hey guys, Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius here! Does anyone else get sad hearing all the professors talk about how much harder the CS, Physics, Math, Chemistry, and Engineering classes used to be and how every year they make them easier? I'm also always surprised by how many Cornell STEM majors actually can't make it through CS2110, 3410, 4820, 4120, PHYS 1116, 2217, 2218, 7652, CHEM 2080, 2150, 3590, 6660, MATH 6110,  7510, 7160, 7130, 7810, without relying very heavily on office hours (like they wouldn't pass if the TA's didn't jetpack them through half the assignments).

I had absolutely no prior experience, never did any work over the summer/breaks to prepare for my classes. In fact, I'm actually a twelve year old, so I didn't even officially get into cornell! I shouldn't even be a ""top student"", but somehow I get several hundred SD's above the mean on every exam without studying, and it makes 0 sense because like I said, I don't even ""deserve"" to be here. You all seem to think I'm some crazy genius but I'm not, I'm just a normal, average boy genius student.

I've been a TA before and I hated it because students expected me to walk them through every step of the project, didn't even attempt to do anything before coming to office hours, and would get upset when I didn't debug their code, fix their bugs for them, or tried balance guiding them through their problems while also not giving away the answers. Come on! This is like when Sheen wanted me to find his Ultra Lord figure for him! Students who know what theyre doing don't come to office hours until the upper level classes. Why do they even have office hours in the lower level classes when you can just ask your robot dog for the answers?

Like I'm not trying to shame people, but Cornell is SUPPOSED to be hard, and not everyone is cut out for it or naturally good at it. Some of you are no better than Carl! I'm sick of every semester there being some piazza/ed/reddit post for every single one of my classes about how ""this class was too much work it's too much mental strain I can't do the projects"" like then why are you still in Cornell if you can't handle it? Wait for a second... think... think.. thiiiink.... BRAINBLAST!  It's OK to not be good at Cornell, not everyone has to be a Cornell grad! I'll make an invention to take people who struggle at Cornell, and put them somewhere else! Maybe to McSpankies, with that simpleton, Skeet.

It's frustrating for the actual top level boy geniuses that came to Cornell to be challenged. Next thing you know, I'm going to see my fellow Cornellian students people are gonna go around calling sodium chloride salt! Ha!

Whoops! The A.I Jimmy Neutron bot that I created to take all of my classes for me is now rampaging through Ithaca... Gotta blast!

163,mtf18j,vyvyanne_ayrs,462.0,0.96,68,Cornell,"Hi, I’m a junior at USC, and last year I was sexually assaulted by a former USC student who at the time was finishing his 4th (final) year. He drugged and raped me, and then tried to allege I was mentally unstable to my professors and friends. I filed a Title IX case against him and after a long 7-month battle he was expelled from the university about a week before his would-be graduation. This was in May of last year. 

I was over the moon. I thought he got what he deserved and that he would not be able to stay in the US and continue his studies there (he’s an international student). 

Obviously, I did not hear about him after - we did not have any mutual friends. That was, until last week, when a friend of a friend told me in confidence that my rapist was, in fact, admitted into a masters program at Cornell and he is currently studying there. I checked the student directory and saw someone with his name - he has quite a unique name, so I’m sure it’s him. 

I cannot believe this. They really let him in, just like that. Do they not check title ix records? How could that be possible? I have all of the title ix paperwork to prove what happened, along with signatures from the vice-president of student affairs at USC. Is it possible that Cornell admissions officers just don’t know about this? 

I guess my question here is - Is there anyone I could talk to about this? Admissions staff? Uni government? I would appreciate any help. Thanks.

EDIT1: Thank you everyone for all the support, I will update you if this process moves forward. I have contacted the Title IX office at Cornell, waiting for their reply now. I will make sure to update you guys if this goes forward. 

I’ve been getting a lot of questions about the student directory - you actually can use it if you’re not a Cornell student, but you can only see the people’s names, nothing else.

The amount of guilt-tripping and complaints over every little inconvenience is so embarrassing. Right now i'm specifically referring to the student who wrote an essay in the VIEN1104 EdStem about how unfair it was that they could not go back on their quiz and that they were ""denied the right to submit answers they were confident in"" despite their being a 60-minute time limit for an open-book 20 question multiple choice quiz (literally the answers were word for word from the lecture). The teachers in this class are sooo fucking nice and there's literally 10% extra credit (yes, you can get a 110% in VIEN1104 and the class is already straightforward). Students already complained about ATTENDING LECTURE so they doubled attendance points and reduced the # of lectures. I cringe the way some of you talk to TAs and Professors in office hours and interrupt class because you think a stressful semester excuses any individual accountability. You are not owed a free A this semester because of COVID. Shoutout to my one professor who responded to a student who interrupted saying ""i forgot about the quiz this week,  we need more announcements about module quizzes"" with ""I am not your mother"". There's complaints relating to student's general lack of organization and preparation that they're now putting on professors and blaming on the burden of COVID, in situations that there is no reason to do so. The way you complain would make it seem as if you are in the hospital awaiting a lung transplant for your COVID diagnosis. OBVIOUSLY there needs to be some level of understanding about accommodating increased stress, but this doesn't mean we just obliterate the standards that exist in any normal semester. Shut the fuck up, get a planner, and do your work, thank you!!

I met my girlfriend in an engineering class freshman year and we spent a lot of time together doing problem sets over the years in Duffield.  This meant many late nights together where we grew closer and developed a strong love for each other.  

I've made the decision I want to marry her and I think it's only fitting that I propose to her on the last day of classes (this Friday) in the Duffield atrium at around 12:30PM in the open area near the doors that lead outside to the engineering quad.  If some people are ready with cameras to record this, I will appreciate it since I know we'll remember this day forever.

As many of you know, I teach the game design courses in the Spring.  At the end of the semester we have historically have a public Showcase were we fill Carpenter Hall with games and people.  Obviously that is not possible in the current semester.  So instead we are going online.

On Tuesday May 25th at 4pm, we are going to be making all of the games available for download. In addition, we will be opening our Discord server to the public for streaming. So you can play the games on your own, watch other people play them, or even stream your own sessions. The details are available on our main Showcase site:

[https://gdiac.cs.cornell.edu/showcase/](https://gdiac.cs.cornell.edu/showcase/)

While nothing is yet available for download, you can see the games that will be showcased on that day.

When we did this last year, it was incredibly successful.  We had at least 600+ visitors on our Discord server. I would like to get a similar turn-out this year.  So I hope to see some of you there on Tuesday.

**Date:** Tuesday, May 25th

182,nl3p2h,BubblyConsideration_,464.0,0.99,18,Cornell,"As my last semester of undergrad comes to a close, I’ve been doing some reflection and wrote down what I wish I’d known as a freshman. I still feel like a freshman lol. Insane. 

1. **Mental + physical health > Grades.** If you’re so worried about what professional/grad schools will think, trying to sacrifice your health for grades isn’t going to make it any better. It’ll be like a domino effect - you’ll be an unhappy, burned out undergrad, who’ll graduate to become an unhappy, burned out med student, or law/grad student. You’ll be unhappy, for the rest of your life. Do work hard, but give yourself room to grow and things will work out for the best.
2. **Resist the bait of imposter syndrome.** It’s a trap. You might think, *”Everyone here is so smart and talented and accomplished I don’t belong here.”* And then eventually get so discouraged that you miss out on so many opportunities you could’ve had. Don’t fall into the trap. You obviously belong here. Not everyone wears their fear on their sleeves. A lot of people are feeling the same way, and you just don’t realize it. We’re all scared. I think usually the higher we go, the more anxieties we have about where we stand. Building the confidence we need takes time. 
3. **Quality > Quantity of friends.** The more friends, the more drama. Not worth it - don’t waste time finding more friends than you need. Find friends who’ll genuinely not give a shit when you make a fool of yourself, when you’ve fallen, when you’re at your worst - even if it’s just one or two people
4. **It’s okay to make mistakes.** College is *the* time to make mistakes. If things don’t work out, learn from it and move on. You’re going to come out of it as a much better person. 
5. **Try that thing!** Take that class! Join that club! Just do whatever you’re interested in - there’s literally everything for everyone here. 
6. **No one’s going to judge you** - most people are probably worrying about themselves. This applies to everything - ask that question in lecture, ask for help when you need it.  Literally no one cares if you sound stupid or look stupid or weak or whatever.  They probably don’t think that at all, and if they do, they’re not worth your time to worry about. 
7. **Just be yourself** and avoid putting on a persona you think people will like - people usually hate that. People like sincerity.

*Also, thanks r/Cornell for making my college life less miserable. I’ve come here to laugh, cry, stress.  And everyone here is so supportive - y’all made me feel less alone in times of struggle.

But y'all need to stop freaking out about a single announcement regarding a mask mandate. 

Some of you guys are clearly overreacting and coming up with the worst possible scenarios that are based entirely on speculation

The fact of the matter is, the University NEVER said that we would need to be socially isolated and that indoor activities will be mostly canceled. The University NEVER said that we would need to refrain from doing  things like eating with friends, attending in-person classes, going grocery shopping, exercising, etc. THE UNIVERSITY SIMPLY SAID WE WILL NEED TO WEAR MASKS WHILE DOING THEM. 

What is this wailing and ""woe is me"" attitude that I'm seeing about mask-wearing. Chill the fuck out. 

I agree that social isolation causes depression and depression should not be handled lightly. But the University never said we would need to be socially isolated so I'm not sure where you guys are basing that speculation off of?

The University has absolutely no incentive to call for social isolation UNLESS the health risks are extremely dire as it was last year when we were sent back home. This doesn't seem to be the case right now. They are simply asking us to act like rational human beings and wear a mildly inconvenient piece of fabric over our faces once more whilst we engage in everyday behavior. It's not going to be the same as previous mask mandates where mask wearing was accompanied with extreme social distancing, constant surveillance, and restriction of many activities. 

 Seriously grow the fuck up. What they are asking of us seems like a legit precautionary measure and honestly not that intrusive. Stop with the rhetoric that we are being ""oppressed"" by masks.

It's extremely disappointing from a learning perspective that Cornell has decided to stop encouraging recordings. I gave feedback at every opportunity throughout Covid to say that being able to go back and re-watch recorded lectures improved my ability to learn, and from what I could tell, most others agreed. Apparently, all that feedback was ignored.

Especially in large classes taught in large lecture halls, the infrastructure is already in place to easily record. I see no good justification for not granting students more freedom to learning materials.

Clearly that is stupid even without COVID. I\'d rather you stay home and get better than drag yourself to class, feel worse, and get a dozen other people sick. \n\nIn theory, recording lectures for students who are sick and can\'t make it sounds great. In practice I think there are two problems:\n\n1. Logistics as some others in this thread have mentioned. It\'s pretty seamless with Zoom because you literally just hit a record button, or even set up the meeting to auto-record, and then it automatically shows up in the Canvas cloud recording. Recording in physical classrooms involves more IT infrastructure, possibly moving large files around (e.g. off a camera memory card, to a computer, then upload to Canvas), making sure the recording is getting the same audio as the room speakers if you have a mic, how to handle switching camera feeds or aim if you\'re using a doc cam or walking around or showing demos that need close-ups etc etc - you either need a live person physically in the room operating a camera, or you have to plan your lecture around what can be recorded. That doesn\'t work 100% of the time, and all of this is more work for SOMEONE, whether it be the instructor, a TA, or IT staff. \n2. ""I can watch this later if I\'m sick"" very easily turns into ""I have more important things to do right now so I will watch this later at 1.5x speed, but just this one lecture"" and that turns into ""OK I\'m having a bad week but I will binge all the lectures this weekend"" and then it turns into ""AAAHHH I am irrevocably far behind in this course."" I saw stories like that over and over again on this sub over the last year. Heck, it happened to *me*. Told myself I was going to sit in on the live Zoom lectures for a colleague\'s course. Made it a few weeks, then had a busy week, told myself I would catch up later...guess how that ended. So I think the concern is that even if there are good intentions, in reality it will just result in a lot of students choosing to do other things instead of attend live classes. I teach a participation-heavy course so that really doesn\'t work for me - students simply aren\'t getting as much out of it if they watch a recording later that shows *other* students participating. \n\nGiven the above, my plan is not to record lectures, but to structure the class so students don\'t feel like they are being punished for taking an occasional sick day (e.g. lots of available resources like good notes and short pre-recorded videos on certain topics, and some participation credit for iClicker/pollEV but way more ""dropped days"" than before).', 'score': 24, 'created_utc': 1628036301.0}, {'author': 'IntlEng', 'body': ""Hmmm could it be intellectual property rights concerns?

I think the main concern with recording is that, it\'s very easy to not attend a lecture it you know it\'s recorded, especially mid-semester when assignments start to feel overwhelming.  \n\nYou think to yourself, well, it\'s only one lecture. But what if you can\'t find the time to watch that lecture before the next one? You say ""well, nothing is gonna make sense now so I\'ll just wait for the weekend and do those two lectures and be ready for next week."" And then the weekend comes, and you are tired from everything, and you have a bunch of homework to finish, and your friends want to hang out, and you just don\'t have time. Then those two lectures you couldn\'t/didn\'t attend become 4, 5, 10, and at some point, you just can\'t catch up anymore.\n\nObviously if you go to the lecture this doesn\'t apply to you. Or some people have the discipline to not let this happen but this is not the case for MOST people (including me).\n\nYou can say, give only those who attend the lecture the ability to rewatch then. Unfortunately, with in person classes there is no time-efficient way to figure this out. Even if there was, what\'s likely to happen is that the students who couldn\'t attend the lecture will start bothering those who did for the recordings and we don\'t want that.\n\nOn top of these, we all know it was significantly harder to teach AND learn over Zoom. So, yes, recordings helped you; but chances are you WILL concentrate better in person (especially if you come prepared knowing that there won\'t be recordings), and your instructors WILL teach better, and it WILL be easier to ask your questions to your instructor, TAs, and friends.\n\nIs it perfect? No. But given all of the above, not recording seems to be benefitting the most number of people, and reducing the number of people who will ""fall through the cracks."" \n\nIn an ideal world, all instructors would have the ability to develop asynchronous courses the students can follow whenever they have the time. This would be great especially for those who have jobs and/or families. I hope one day we will have that, but at this time, most of your instructors are research-focused and not teaching-focused, and they simply cannot/do not prioritize teaching more than they currently do.\n\nYou should also know that the main reason the classes were even recorded is that some students couldn\'t attend the lectures at a reasonable time because of time zone/family/etc. concerns.

Your incompetence is disrespectful and unacceptable. No student paying $75k+ and signing that check with an ounce of their blood should have to endure the treatment you have made standard. We shouldn't have to wait until the deadline passes for a half-assed generalization of an answer on what you are doing to ensure things are set for the year. Being put on hold almost all day then being hung up on because you couldn't be bothered to address the concerns of those your role is to support may be a norm for you but it most definitely is not a thing we will take.

This is not the first time aid has been tardy and with your track record, it certainly won't be the last. It's not even the only complaint about your offices. Charges appear and disappear throughout the year, you issue refunds that you then want back, you constantly raise the bar for financial aid eligibility, scholarship checks disappear when they reach your hands and your stupid bureaucratic processes make it borderline impossible to receive concise information on what exactly is going on. From personal experience, I have come to your office 4+ times with the same question and each time, I have received a different answer from a different person. Do you even know what the fuck you are doing?

Personally, I have not talked to a student who does not have at least one thing to complain about when your offices are brought up. It speaks volumes on how lazy, unprofessional and unknowledgeable you are. Many of you have worked in those offices for years if not decades yet on a regular basis, act clueless when basic questions on student accounts are asked. Why do you act like this information is top secret and make students have to go through time-wasting procedures for a simple one-sentence answer? Why does it take a miracle to simply locate logistical information on your website? Why is it so difficult for you to audit your internal workflow and create timely and effective processes that cut out on shit like this?

If you are short staffed or something is hindering your responsibilities, say so. Don't beat around the bush with endless nonsense then ghost students. It presents a very negative image of Cornell as a whole and leaves both students and parents with a bad taste in their mouths when you pull foolish stunts like these.

193,p864ef,ConnectionFun7919,273.0,0.99,24,Cornell,"**Is X schedule too much?** Maybe, depends how much time you are willing to spend working. There isn't a point in overloading on credits if you're not trying to boost your GPA. Probably take 15  your first semester and see how well you can handle that.

edit: You might consider starting off with 18+ credits and dropping courses within the drop period based on how well you can handle them/which courses you like the most

**What do people wear to class?** What they wore in HS. Some people dress preppy, most are casual.

**How much free time do students usually have?**

Depends how you work, what you study, and what your priorities are. Most people have a good work-life balance (i.e. basically school 9-5 and life outside of that).

**How cold does it get?**

Cold. Bring the clothes you would bring on a ski trip. You haven't gone skiing? OK. Bring a winter jacket, pants, boots, gloves and a hat.

**What's the best way to make friends?**

Don't think about how you are coming off to other people. Everyone is nervous, and everyone wishes someone would come up to them and make friends. Don't pity yourself because nobody is going out of their way to be your friend, when you're not doing the same :) Asking people to go out to the dining hall is a great way to get started. Promise yourself to do things that make you uncomfortable.

**What is the political culture like?**

What you would see at pretty much any NE college

**Is Cornell actually depressing and stressful or is that just a stereotype?**

College is stressful, learning to manage stress is the key. Stop with the defeatist mentality and own up to your mistakes. Cornell's suicide rate thing is a myth.

**Is the student culture collaborative or competitive?**

I hate this question. There's usually a GroupMe for most classes. Do people want to give you homework answers? Probably not. If you work hard, people will want to work with you. I've never experienced anyone trying to f\*ck me over.

**Is there grade deflation?**

Honestly? No. There's just so many smart kids here that aren't used to getting lower grades. If you look at the medians, most classes have a median of B+/A-

\*\*Getting a research position?\*\*Email, email, email. You miss every shot you don't take. Not the end of the world if you don't get one as a freshman.

**How do I handle stress--will my parents find out if I go to Cornell Health?**

Getting a bad grade is not the end of the world. You will not always be popular, you might not ever be popular. You might even be a loner at times. If you put your best foot forward, it will always get better. BE HONEST WITH YOURSELF about the choices you make and why you're in the situation you are in. The world is NOT out to get you.

Things are never as bad as they seem, I really mean that. Talk to professors, advisors, counselors, RAs, 99.99% of the time there's a way out of your ""horrible"" situation. Take this from someone who went from almost failing freshman year to getting consecutive 4.0s.

You have to f\*ck up many times over to be f\*cked with a Cornell degree.

**How hard is it to get into X club? Are they super competitive?**

Maybe. You lose nothing by trying out, and being in x club won't guarantee/prevent you from getting x  internship/job.

**What is the party scene like/I've never been to a party, what do I do/I don't like parties**

The party scene is there if you want it, and you can always find a party with people that are similar to you (even if you think you are the weirdest person ever). Parties do exist outside of Greek life, though it's much harder for guys that are not part of it. No matter what it looks like, not everyone drinks, and drinking is not necessary for fun and relaxation. It's a social lubricant, and nothing more. Same thing goes for Greek life though, there really is a house for everyone. Even if you don't rush, make friends with someone in a house and go to their parties. Or don't.

Nobody cares what you are doing, bar being creepy or making a scene. NOBODY DOESN'T LIKE PARTIES.

**Any question about important academic choices:**

Ask your advisor. They will respond. They want to help you. Do not make a decision based on what Reddit tells you.

**Do freshmen land internships?**

Most don't because companies don't want freshmen. Focus on your GPA and enjoy your summer.

**How is the workload?**

Depends. How much do you work? If you treat school like a job (work 9-5), you'll probably do really well.

**What is it like as a low/middle income student?**

One thing I will say about this is that Cornell students are not as universally rich as this Reddit would make it seem. Even the more well off kids aren't just getting funneled money from mommy and daddy (for the most part). It has not impacted my experience.

**What's your biggest tip for incoming freshman?**

* GO TO CLASS. Once you look for reasons to not go, you're in danger!!
* If you go to all your classes and do all the assignments, you’ll be ahead of most of your classmates. SOMEHOW THIS IS TRUE AT CORNELL.
* GO TO OFFICE HOURS.
* YOUR PARENTS ARE RIGHT -->> NUMBER ONE PRIORITY IS SCHOOOOOOOOL
* MAKE TIME TO EXERCISE
* GET A PLANNER --> WORK ON ASSIGNMENTS EVERY DAY WITHIN A WEEK OF THEIR DUE DATE --> STUDY AT LEAST 2 HOURS A DAY A WEEK BEFORE YOUR EXAMS  --> NEVER SUBMIT THINGS AT THE LAST MINUTE, IT BIASES YOUR GRADERS --> SPEND 10 MINUTES A DAY REVIEWING CLASS MATERIAL AND ASK QUESTIONS AS SOON AS THEY COME UP!!!!

**BIGGEST TIP**

No. One. Gives. A. Fuck.

When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw her trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in her hands without paying.

The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Ma'am, you need to pay for those first.” At first she kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.

When the girl took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, Martha stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me.

As a RPME employee, I can say with confidence that this has been the worst group of freshman I’ve seen at my time at Cornell. Honestly, I will quit and it 1000% is the fault of the students (because the staff members are incredible).

However, I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt. Maybe no one taught you basic manners, so I’m here to help!

PICK UP AFTER YOURSELF! Bring your dishes and cups to the dish return. Idk why I keep seeing disgusting tables at the end of my shift… I promise you, it wasn’t this disgusting pre-covid. I also promise you that, when you visit a west campus dining hall, it won’t look this disgusting!! We are not your mother and you’re also a grown adult. So please!

LISTEN TO US! We work at the dining hall… you don’t!!! I don’t understand why I have customers fighting me on why we don’t have ice cream… the fridge was broken and we couldn’t put any out; you catching an attitude with us isn’t going to make us put out ice cream…

PLEASE WEAR YOUR MASK WHEN GETTING FOOD!! I know masks are a hot topic on campus and Cornell loves diverse opinions… but the dining hall is not the time to be getting political. Student workers signed up to serve food, not to catch COVID-19. You are putting us at risk every time you refuse to wear a mask. We don’t know where you have been and we don’t want to catch whatever disease you have (whether it’s covid or the common cold, we still don’t want it!!) if we get sick, the dining hall won’t function and you’ll have a worse dining experience with wayyy more delays. No one wants that

DOWNLOAD THE GET APP. It’s not cute when you try to delay the line by refusing the download a simple app. On that note, PLEASE WAIT YOUR TURN TO SWIPE. The machines we work with are very slow and they often glitch/stop working. You trying to swipe is not helping and you’re also not paying. When the machine glitches(or we are trying to help another customer with a different way of paying) the machine does not actually register your swipe and hence you have to do it again and wait your turn anyway. Also stop swiping with screen shots or other random bar codes (someone tried swiping in with a movie ticket???) it messes up the machine, causing more delays

IF YOU DONT KNOW SOMETHING, ASK! I rather you come up to me and ask me than you trying to figure out a solution yourself. Most of the time, you end up making the situation so much worse.

When we say “excuse me”, please move! Don’t look at me and expect me to go around you. You are making my job harder and you are causing more delays for everyone.

DO NOT THROW OR DAMAGE OUR EQUIPMENT. Thanks

TAKE A MODERATE AMOUNT OF FOOD. Yes we only have a limited amount of food and yes we run out. Its all you can eat but I promise you, you won’t be eating all that food. You will be contributing to our food waste problem. Get some food, sit down and eat, then come back and get more. The food isn’t going to walk away. You will soon see that you will get full and realize you don’t want more food.

Please be patient. We are severely understaffed. You can wait a couple of seconds. Don’t try to take things from me, just give me 5 seconds to put out more food. I promise you, you can wait.

This is a short list of things on my mind but keep in mind this is not a complete list. I just ask that you try to be a decent human being and use your common sense.

Thank you for reading! Be sure to send this info to any freshman you know. These rules also apply to sophomores who have not learned the rules of the dining halls.

197,pj4hhz,No_Conference2005,261.0,0.96,19,Cornell,"1. Optional arrival testing - the dumbest fking decision ever made. Even if most of the student population is vaccinated, arrival week is probably the one time of the year where we have a mass influx of people from all over the country and the world. For an institution of higher learning, you would think that it would be obvious that they did rigorous arrival testing to account for this fact.
2. Outdoor mask mandates. It's stupid and unscientific and it's not even being enforced.
3. Complete disregard for unvaccinated (due to medical conditions) / partially vaccinated (due to being an international) / quarantined students. The university should have given these students accommodation to not be incentivized to go to classes. Only now are they urging professors to seek ways for these students to continue learning in an undisturbed manner
4. sub-par ""contact tracing"" - Now I have numerous student accounts of roommates, classmates who tested positive and were still left to roam around the campus. Contrary to Cornell Administration's assurance that their testing and contact tracing is ""robust"" the reality is anything but.
5. Threatening to go fully online after receiving all dat phat money. Not again.
6. Increasing freshman admissions and North dorms, without increasing eateries and dining halls to accommodate for the increase. Hence the dining hall madness that is ensuing right now.
7. Financial Aid fuck ups 
8. General lack of infrastructure to support the student body. As mentioned in the comments, just completely overwhelmed staff members across the board 

And it's only been 2 weeks! I've been at Cornell for 4 years, and this semester is probably the worst. Granted, we are in an unprecedented time of crisis - but some of the decisions like no arrival testing, and blindly admitting more freshman without taking into consideration increased strain on dining halls is inexcusable regardless of the pandemic situation.

I wasn't surprised that people like you exist, but I hate that you are in my lectures that I and everyone else have to go to three times a week. While I obviously don't want to catch covid and go into isolation, I was mainly irritated by your callous attitude.

One of my loved ones recently had to cross borders just to see her husband in hospital, who was struggling to breathe due to covid, and to take care of her only son. She will have to spend a total of 31 days in quarantine. Many professors go home to their unvaccinated children, and they too have no choice but to go to in-person lectures with people like you. I have a close friend who cannot get the vaccine because of an allergy. So much of Cornell still hasn't returned to normal. Covid has changed everyone and everything except your dumb asses. I probably won't catch it from you today, but it still saddens me that you refuse to do a very simple thing that will keep everyone safe + bring us closer to normalcy. I don't care what you do in your own time, but for the love of camels, wear a mask in lectures.

Shoutout to Professor Clarkson for being a GOAT and taking it seriously. All I had to say was ""the two guys in front of me weren't wearing a mask"" and he said ""I will take care of it"".

204,q2kkjp,DatNeuroBioNerd22,259.0,0.96,49,Cornell,"So context. I’m in a class with a visiting prof and after the drop deadline for 7 week courses ended his personality completely morphed. He went from kind and compassionate to a horrendous human. And he has spent a long time constantly targeting me in these implicit ways by either pretending I don’t contribute, quickly moving on without an acknowledgement, or emphasizing how I should have followed the point of his fave. 

I thought I was the only one noticing this until I worked with my group and yeah, we noticed his targeting of some folks. Today though he crossed a line. We were having a discussion and so I was sharing a strategy that was inspired by my own experience. People had questions for me so I just answered as it was a discussion but the professor goes in and says how I am boring, I’m boring everyone, my point is pointless, and I’m talking too much. What the fuck… 

In reflections for this prof I’ve already mentioned my severe anxiety and my insane lack of confidence. And he justified it saying he was playing into gender roles and I just made myself a target. He actually polled the class and asked how many people were bored with what I was saying. Not one person raised their hand. They were all completely shocked. No one talked after that. How could you? You just watched a professor tear a student down completely to bits. I had my camera off (thank god) and proceeded to cry in peace. He sent me some private chat and I didn’t bother reading it. 

What’s upsetting is nothing will happen to him. He’s a visiting prof, the class is extremely small, and no one probably is going to care. But the trauma will stick with me. I’m not okay. I’m not. I feel so broken by this whole experience. He justified abuse by making the victim feel like the offender. He just taught us how to abuse and bully people and make it okay. Previously he has said we don’t need to take people’s emotions into account as leaders among other such horrible statements. But I just needed to share something here because I don’t want to break my veil of anonymity and say these words out loud. 

I don’t want to talk anymore. I wish I didn’t have to.","[{'author': 'None', 'body': 'Lol I know who this is.

206,q6s3u5,join_cs0000,273.0,0.99,10,Cornell,"It's that time of year again: you need to go to New York City so you can take a selfie in Central Park. Unfortunately, you're in a rush (break ends tomorrow and you still have an essay to write!), so you don't have time plan a trip via bus, nor do you have a car so you can't go yourself. Dejected, you resign yourself to not being able to take a selfie under the skyscrapers. But wait! You see a post on the Cornell subreddit: ""Traveling to NYC today, anyone need a lift?"" How generous -- a total stranger is offering to drive you to NYC for free!

You DM them on Reddit and work out a meeting location. A few hours later, you meet them just outside campus and get in their car, and you set off for NYC. Everything goes well at first, although the inside of their car is plastered with essay drafts. You think that's odd, but don't read their contents -- after all, he's giving you a free ride, what gives you the right to be nosy?

About a half an hour into the drive, the driver turns off the radio, turns around, and smiles at you.

""Sure is great being at Cornell, huh?""

""Sure"", you respond.

""Yeah, there are so many things I love about campus."" There's a worrying air to his vagueness. ""The academics, the campus, the culture..."" he trails off, still looking directly at you. ""Hey, what do *you* think makes Cornell so special?""

Oh no.

Oh no no no no no. You check the doors. They're locked. You look around for a weapon, anything to break the windows open with, but no success. You are trapped in the car with a prospective applicant, and there's no way he'll let you leave until you write his essay for him.

""Listen, I don't want to bother you, I just re*all*y need a li*ttle*... *inspi*ration,,,"" he twitches, with a pained, deranged smile. ""*Don't* think of it like *copyi*ng, think of it like *helpi*ng a *friend*."" He pulls out a switchblade and looks at it lovingly, then stares directly into your soul. ""Won't y*ou g*ive me some in*spira*tion?""

He's still not looking at the road. You look in front of the car, transfixed: a hero is slowly levitating down from the heavens. They land on the road and outstretch their hand. The car impacts the palm and is immediately crumpled by its momentum, as if the mystery superhero was made of solid stone. The applicant, still looking away from the road, barely had any time to process what was happening before he was flung through the windshield and onto the pavement. Then your head hits the headrest and everything goes black.

&#x200B;

You wake up outside the car. You feel fine, but your vision is a bit blurry. You see the applicant on the pavement, injured and withering. He notices the superhero towering over him and feebly tries to crawl away, then flips on his back, looks up at the superhero, and pleads: ""No, please, I just needed some inspiration -- it's an exception, I swear, please, it's an exception -- don't""

The superhero closes their eyes. Chains erupt from the ground around the applicant and encircle him in a web of twisted steel. A titanium padlock materializes out of thin air and locks the chains together, trapping the applicant for all eternity. Your vision is clearing, and you're finally able to make out the superhero. It's /u/pw11111. They open their eyes, look at you, and smile. Then they look back at the defeated applicant.

Infinite time he said, open internet (except no search engine) he said. Fair is fair.

I brought with me a week’s ration of canned foods, a personal tent, a sleeping bag, a water boiler, two boxes of 48 ramen packets, three gallons of cold brew, two umbrellas, a portable electric range, a diesel power generator, and a stuffed animal with me to the prelim.

I was prepared, but Prof. Rachit Agarwal was not prepared for the concept of *infinite time*; he stared in wide-eyed horror as I began to pitch a literal tent right next to the podium. Students gaped as I unwrapped a ramen bag and dropped it into the boiling water of my pot, the scent of artificial chicken began to waft through the air. While it was cooking, I did part a of section 1 of problem 1. All is well.

I fished out a lighter from my bag and dropped a lit match on the pile of firewood in front of my tent as I checked my 3-sentence answer languidly. The carpet next to my campfire began to smoke. TAs watched me intently as I put three marshmallows (*three*! The luxury!) onto my reusable marshmallow stick and roasted them over the fire until they were a shade of delightful golden-brown. At this point, half of the students have already left, but I was in no hurry— I have infinite time.

As I got wrapped up with question B of part 2 of section 1, I was the only student left in the room. I grew a little tired— it was 3 AM, after all. I stretched, and Prof. Rachit Agarwal watched helplessly as I laid down my sleeping bag and my stuffed animal. I asked him to tuck me in, and he said no. I slept for a peaceful eleven hours and decided to start my morning (or rather, afternoon) with finishing question C of part 4 of section 1. At this point, he came up to me and told me that he would give me extra credit if I could just wrap the damn thing up. I told him no, because I value fairness. He heaved a heavy sigh and sank back into his seat.

After 30 minutes of working on the prelim, I took a break. Prof. Agarwal looked like he was on the edge of a mental breakdown when he heard the sound of the fourth “This is *your* Daily Dose of Internet” beginning to come out of my tinny speakers. I closed my laptop; my tea must have finished steeping at this point.

I am currently working on part 2 of problem 2. Gotta go check on my instant dumplings and ask Rachit if he wants some. Wish me luck, folks.","[{'author': 'null_panda', 'body': 'Bro can I have a marshmellow for Prelim 2 🥺 they smelled so good but I felt bad asking cause I didn’t want to disturb the other test takers', 'score': 63, 'created_utc': 1634344425.0}, {'author': 'CanadianCitizen1969', 'body': ""Can't wait for another update- I'm hooked!"", 'score': 30, 'created_utc': 1634352224.0}, {'author': 'Material-Tomorrow610', 'body': 'Wait is this real?

This is not the first SA or sexual harassment incident perpetrated by the same sophomore. During his study away program last year at Zhejiang University, a similar incident happened with an alleged minor. At the time of this post (11/2), there are currently five female students who voiced their experiences — four from Cornell and one from another school. For safety reasons, please respect and protect their privacy.

Keep in mind that most victims of SA are already acquainted with the perpetrator. Please stay safe and follow cornell\_against\_sexual\_assault on Instagram for updates.

Edit1: Thank you for all of your upvotes and supportive comments! We're unable to provide further information at the moment, but in terms of the case's progress, the victim already contacted the CUPD after the SA incident on Friday. A petition form might be circulating in the next few days, so please be on the lookout.

And now the filters are broken because both pools haven't been renovated since the 50s, but instead of actually putting money towards fixing the facilities so that students can use the things they paid for, they're just draining and refilling the pools every week???

Not only that, but in order to increase the longevity of the pools without having to fix them, they're just kicking everyone out and only allowing varsity swim to use them? Club water polo, club swim, and many other aquatic clubs have been barred from using them entirely, which is ridiculous, because they're very integral parts to many students' lives and deserve just as much right to use the pools as varsity swim.

Open swim has been stopped too, which would be understandable if they were fixing things so that students could use them soon, but they're not, so what now?

This is kind of a long shot- but last night i was walking home and in front of 626 a car pulled over and asked if i was ok. I was not. I was legitimately sobbing, there was blood all over my legs and I was trying to get back to ctown with a locked phone. I really am just making this post because the two people who drove me home, I legitimately think you saved my life and I am so thankful and while I kept saying it in the car I don’t think it was emphasized enough. So if you drove a severely emotional clearly traumatized girl from north to ctown last night: thank you so much. you truly are what’s right with humanity

231,raa679,Anaklusmos726,317.0,0.98,53,Cornell,"I have decided to put the university up for sale. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to purchase a property with great historical value. There are multiple incredible buildings across the campus. On North Campus you can find the amazing Balch Hall which houses some exotic pets including bats and beetles. The Arts Quad hosts the colossal Goldwin Smith Hall which is filled with fake statues straight from ancient Greece. On the street behind this hall you can find PSB, the coldest building on the entire planet (world record). Central Campus has the clocktower which plays loud, incessant music on some bells (?) even when you are trying to study. Inside the building with the clocktower is the Cocktail Lounge which does not serve cocktails and is not in fact a lounge. There is also of course the Engineering Quad with some great spots like Duffield Hall which always has something going on (need I say more?). Heading left from there you can find the Statler Hotel, ex-home of some of Cornell's first ever COVID patients! Now down the MOUNTAIN (wrongfully titled Libe SLOPE despite the slope literally being infinity) from Central Campus is West Campus where the architects of Cornell decided to put almost every single dining hall (which are rarely open at convenient times, but that's because Cornell is ensuring we all stay skinny). East from Central Campus you can find one of the best places on the property, the Dairy Bar, which serves ice cream sourced straight from the genius cows kept in the Big Red Barn. On the way back from this building you can stop by the Ag Quad which has the best library on campus, Mann, where even the mice of Cornell want to live. There are a few other delicious leftovers on campus including Gates Hall, sponsored by Bill himself, and Schoelfubrefobgdsfdff Field where you can burn yourself on the metal benches on a hot day (good for your skin). Finally if you head down south from Central Campus you reach, of course, South Campus where you can find the spacious and modern Cascadilla Hall (also for sale). This dorm keeps you fit by making sure that the elevators never arrive when you click the button so you have to take the stairs. Also on South Campus is Sheldon Court above Collegetown Bagels (easy access to food and excellent for stalking people from the window) and a few other dorms scattered about. As for nature, North Campus has Beebe Lake where you can go kayaking (right over the waterfall) and South Campus has Cascadilla Gorge which is sure to someday cause Cascadilla Hall to collapse in a sinkhole.

239,rfi6bt,johnfrengtippycanoe,266.0,0.89,95,Cornell,"How viral evolution works, is that over time, viruses become more contagious and less lethal. Let’s take the [Spanish Flu](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.ft.com/content/4eabdc7a-f8e1-48d5-9592-05441493f652) of 1918 for example; it infected one third of the world’s population as it ravaged the globe, and gruesome carnage ensued. Over time, however, many hypothesize that it got milder and milder, and even though its pathogenic lineage was responsible for disease outbreaks into the 1950s and 60s, it shifted from a deadly pandemic to a less potent, somewhat milder illness with intermittent gaps in infections.

What we are seeing with Covid-19 follows a similar trajectory; an increasingly large fraction of the American population has been infected. While wild type and beta variants ushered in ICU overloads and high fatalities, the consensus is that omicron is less severe. Even with delta, as some members of r/Cornell point out, cases have been surging throughout the Northeast, and yet hospital occupancy hasn’t reached anywhere near its highest levels. While we aren’t at the end yet, it’s seeming like milder, more contagious variants will come to dominate. This ensures two things: many of us will likely get covid-19, and few of us (barring those with underlying conditions) will become dangerously sick. 

Given that we’ve isolated, distanced, worn masks, and made enormous personal, career, and academic sacrifices to protect others who are more vulnerable able than we are for what will soon enough be two years, at what point is it unfair to ask the triple-vaxxed and asymptomatic to spend 10 days isolated from society? At what point is it unfair to ask us to damage our mental health for societal benefit? 

I’m not saying it is yet — I want to be clear that I will follow all current measures stringently, and respect those more vulnerable to disease than I am. But unless we ask these questions, this may very well go on forever.

240,rfsj4r,KrzysisAverted,322.0,0.93,32,Cornell,"Cornell's administration has shown that their risk assessment is motivated by self-interest rather than even their own testing data. Finals are going forward with 200+ positives per day while homecoming was cancelled over what, comparatively, might as well be a rounding error.

If they try to cancel **in-person** Slope Day for you guys over anything less than the number of positives we're currently seeing on campus, you should protest. Make a promise to yourself now, that you will.

Slope day is outdoors, in open air; they can tell you to wear masks when less than six feet apart if they're *really* cautious. But compare that to in-person finals with hundreds of students in the same indoor space.

You could preemptively make a petition (Qualtrics) reflecting this, but don't assume it'll guarantee anything.

If Cornell mentions that they're even considering cancelling it, you should organize a time and place, and go protest in person. Social distance, wear masks, be smart about it, but make yourself seen. Cornell is getting paid nearly 70K a year for every single undergraduate student enrolled (remember that if you're on financial aid, someone else is still paying that amount for you) and you deserve better than this nonsense.

200 positives a day didn't warrant cancelling in-person finals.

So, no fewer than 200 positives per day should warrant skimping out on an in-person Slope Day--for most current students, the first one they've ever had.","[{'author': 'None', 'body': ""I'm all for reasonable COVID measures like testing and masks.

Let me start my argument by stating Cornell Reddit is not in any way representative of the student body here (nothing wrong with y’all just not an accurate representation). Most students here are generally happy. I was very scared coming in from a public high school in a small town with friends who either went to local colleges or none at all. But in my time here I’ve gotten involved in things and met people I never would have thought possible. 

From joining a social Greek life org (something I wouldn’t have done at basically any other college but Cornell Greek life really does have a house for everyone) to getting involved in random clubs that have nothing to do with careers (as well as a bunch of finance clubs), to meeting lifelong friends, to taking classes that have broadened horizons (and dropped my GPA but who cares), Cornell really has been an amazing experience.

Here are some things to love about Cornell:

1. Diversity in majors and in turn personalities and people (so many unique here compared to other places)
2. Incredible food
3. The hybrid vibe of Ithaca with a small town that has a ton of nature but also a city feel in the commons and collegetown
4. Campus architecture that is an awesome mix of old gothic and new modern structures
5. The larger size is both good and bad but is really good in the sense of never running out of people to meet and things to explore

I am definitely forgetting a lot and I’m sure others can add a lot more.

Now this is not meant to disparage those having a hard time. And Cornell has its fair share of problems that can’t be denied but that is like any other college.  

But to anyone (especially class of 2026) who is reading this and scared of coming or applying to cornell, seriously don’t be. Come check it out, it’s not that bad of a place.

I do not understand what people are complaining about. We had a massive omicron outbreak over the span of one week last semester and learned an important lesson. Cornell is providing tests, masks, and has a sane plan to avoid a similar outbreak. Keep reading before you comment. 

To everyone that disagrees, I pose you one question: WHAT DID YOU EXPECT? Did you expect Cornell to just say “no booster, no masks, no testing” everyone please come on campus and let’s overwhelm Tompkins County!  It’s so selfish to only think about your student experience. We are guests in Ithaca, not residents. We have no right to flood in and turn life upside down for the community. And to the people organizing protests, what are you protesting? The virus exists if you like it or not. No sensible University would allow students to flood in without some sort of testing and containment plan. Look at other schools implementing similar policies. Most of their student bodies aren’t making a fool of themselves like this subreddit is. 

This sub has become like a gas puddle next to a lit match. Anything Martha does is met with hellfire and blowback. YES she’s made some terrible choices, but this plan is literally the best case scenario to avoid a shutdown and online semester. Please stop whining, we’ve ALL lost our normal college experience. You’re not alone. If you seriously can’t handle it because of mental health concerns (which is completely understandable) please look into a semester leave. But don’t flame the school for putting in place policies designed to keep us in-person like we asked for. 

The pandemic is not over. Over the past week, we went from a pro-science, pro-vax community to an inflammatory, anti-everything one. I feel like I went from a community of like-minded individuals who understood that the pandemic is dangerous to a minority of people not in arms about sensible policies. Everyone is suddenly against boosters. Everyone is against banning cloth masks when scientific evidence CLEARLY demonstrates they don’t work. Everyone is against testing. Relax and think: is this really that big of a sacrifice for an in-person semester?

261,sqfmj8,CornellUni-Throwaway,532.0,0.92,222,Cornell,"Since coming to Cornell from my decently small public school in the southeastern US, I have become increasingly aware, annoyed, and alarmed by the vast amount of elitism and privilege that goes unchecked here at Cornell. As a Government major, I also think that I've had a front seat to the many sociopolitical and socioeconomic misunderstandings that inhabit the thought processes of so many of my friends and fellow students. To be clear, I understand that this is a moot point to a lot of people and that many of the very people I am indirectly talking about are reading this. Still, I need to fucking vent about this.

Let’s just start with my first interaction at Cornell! I logged onto the first class of my college education on Zoom: an 8 am seminar-styled humanities class that I was beyond excited for. I had this awesome idea that it would be an introduction to the rigorous academic debate and exchange of ideas from different points of view that I would have to look forward to for the next four years. That was a funny thought. We started doing icebreakers, typical stuff like your hometown, pronouns, major, and name. Finally, it's my turn. I say I'm from \*insert Southern state/region and city here\*. Almost immediately, a fellow student unmutes themself and asks me, ""Do you guys wear shoes where you're from, or have you guys not got there, yet?"" leading to visible laughter in the boxes across my screen and only a semi-annoyed ""okay, sorry, let's keep going"" from the instructor. Wow. What a great way to start my college experience.

Now, understand this, I've got thick skin and I've heard a lot shitty things that are way worse, so it didn't really bother me. However, it made me keenly aware of what sort of response my background would receive and just how genuinely middle-class people are viewed by others at Cornell. 

I've been astounded by so many aspects of the past two years of my education. Some of the statements that have been uttered in my government classes regarding socioeconomic marginalization, of course by someone wearing a brand new, $7,000 Moncler jacket, would be better and more kindly said by saying, “stop being poor, idiots.” I’ve also heard so many different punitive, elitist arguments regarding the southeastern US, my home, that I genuinely feel like I’m the star of a Comedy Central roast sometimes. Statements like, “Just listen to how they speak, you can tell that they’re stupid!” or, “Why do we even care what happens down there? They voted for Trump, they deserve to suffer!” have become so persistent and constant to my damn ears that I’ve just stopped trying to explain how fucked up they are.

Regarding politics specifically, the level of strictly performative activism that so many here at Cornell participate in and think is adequate is quite astounding. Quick newsflash: screenshotting an Instagram post and putting it on your Snapchat story is not helping anyone. I really cannot think of a better example of this than the Ganędagǫ acknowledgment that we see at the end of ‘woke’ students’ emails, university correspondence, and so on. Is it nice to see that? Sure. Does it help heal the deep wounds that institutions like Cornell have wrought for decades? Hell no. See, some of y’all just don’t understand that acknowledgments and building-naming are only step one with issues like that. It might be history to those of you who shop at Chanel with Mommy and Daddy’s money, but it’s very real and very apparent for some of us. 

Speaking of institutional inadequacies in regards to socioeconomic status, let’s talk about Cornell and Financial Aid! If you don’t remember, last semester, a decent chunk of the student population that relies upon need-based financial aid to even think of going here didn’t receive their aid packages until October, or, in worse cases, November. If you’re part of the around fifty percent of the student population that does not rely upon assistance from the University, please try to understand the massive amount of stress that so many had to deal with, entirely unnecessarily. Having a hold on your account and dealing with hopefully empty threats of being put on probation/unenrolled for the Spring semester while also dealing with the shitty day-to-day worries of being a college student at one of the most difficult academic institutions in the world can be a little bit taxing.

Being one of these people, I arranged a meeting with one of the lovely Financial Aid counselors to discuss my Financial Aid package, as well as my options for living off-campus the following year. It would’ve probably been more beneficial to ask this subreddit for advice. After getting nowhere with the status of my aid package, I asked how financial aid operates for students living off-campus and what I should expect my cost of attendance to be. I didn’t get an answer. Instead, the counselor asked me what apartment I was looking at. I showed them the property, the cheapest Collegetown apartment I could find at that time, only to be told that I should probably look for something “more within my means.” They continued this thought and told me that my financial profile indicated I was a “high-need” student and that if I wanted an apartment like that, I would have to take out a considerable amount of loans because Cornell would not help. I would later find out that this was wholly false and that Cornell would indeed help, which was undoubtedly a great revelation, but the fact that I wasn’t told that by someone that worked in that very office was quite upsetting. My theory is that when fifty percent of the student population can afford to go here with no financial assistance, what seems helpful to someone in actual need can seem relatively adequate while truthfully not being sufficient in the slightest.

Finally, can we just mention how fucking ridiculous clubs are here? If you join ‘extracurriculars’ here, you should get a medal, as well as three additional credits to your graduation requirements because you are legitimately taking on so many useless, unnecessary responsibilities for little payoff. Past that, the process of getting into these clubs is equally as corrupt and tilted towards the advantage of elitists as the collegiate admissions process is, if not more. 

Listen, I am not making this post to get pity from strangers on the internet or anything like that. For one, so many people struggle with these dynamics, just as I am. Pity for me will do nothing for them. Secondly, I don’t want pity in the slightest; I want change. I would prefer structural, institutional change, but we all know that’s not going to happen. In lieu of that, I would settle for understanding from the privileged elitists that refuse to think about ‘how the other half lives. There are too many people here that so obviously do not realize how privileged they are to be here. There are too many people here who very clearly did not get in here on their own merits but, instead, they are here for the potential donations that the University could elicit from their guardian. Damn, there are too many people here that are only here because their parents went here or somewhere similar! 

Cornell was founded on the progressive, meritocratic principle of “any person, any study.” A lot of us had to write a whole fucking essay on it to get admitted. It’s a great slogan, but it is simply not true for too many. I wonder way too often what my life would have been like if I didn’t go somewhere so targeted to privilege and elitism. The daily microaggressions and annoyances just pile up so high that I truly do not feel welcome nor meant to be here. As I walk the Arts Quad every day, I continuously feel like an outsider, surrounded by so many that have no definition as to what it even means to be an outsider. I have to remind myself, even now after years of being here, that I fucking worked my ass off to be here; that I deserve to be here. It’s pretty demoralizing that I have to do that so much, but it keeps me going. I know there are a lot of people out there that feel similarly, and I just want y’all to know that you’re not alone. You’re not lesser than others. You belong here just as much as anyone else that put in the work to call this place home. Keep your head down, keep working, and maybe one day we can make things a bit better.

To be clear, I am not trying to demonize anyone that has been blessed with a more fortunate upbringing. All I am saying is that the way things are now blatantly favors y’all while simultaneously making things harder for people that are struggling. This is a systemic/social argument, not a personal one.

And I don't know... I also feel like there's a gap in maturity between students who aren't privileged and students who are because we've had to be more vigilant growing up and take on greater burden/responsibilities that have more significant consequences which makes maintaining relationships very difficult. Obviously, like you said, this isn't anyone's fault.

The clubs that I joined here aren't inviting at all: It feels like being part of a business, even some of the social ones.

The areas known as “Russia” and “Ukraine” have a long history that predates their current post-Cold War borders, the USSR, the world wars, and even the modern period itself. In fact, the precursor to the Russia we know today was founded in 1879 and was known as the [Kievan Rus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kievan_Rus%27)…its capital was literally Kiev. Later, Kiev was part of the [Kiev Viceroyalty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiev_Viceroyalty) (part of the Russian Empire), with the Ukrainian People’s Republic coming into existence in 1917 as a breakaway from the Russian Empire. I say this not to justify an invasion, but to state that in the minds of many Russians, Ukraine is historically Russia, and its existence as an independent state is not justified. \n\n\n2. Putin has made clear that he is displeased with the way that European borders settled post-Cold War. The outgrowth of NATO into the Baltics and post-communist Europe, the pro-EU [Euromaidan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euromaidan) protests in Ukraine, and the influence of western media and ideas on Russians (see support for Navalny) has made Putin feel encroached upon. Putin is interested in a show of force to push back non-Russian influence in Europe, illustrate the weakness of western forces, and gain legitimacy at home.\n\n\n3. Right now, energy prices are high, Nord Stream I is running and NS2 is in progress, China (though its belt & road initiative) has already begun the onslaught of eastern influence on several European states (Greece, Hungary, and Italy), China has aggressed into Hong Kong without repercussion, and the west is dealing with a slew of unpopular and spineless leaders, distracted by at-home Covid and inflation-related troubles. This creates a distracted, divided, dependent west; the invasion time was opportunistic. \n\n\n4. While the west will likely place limited, targeted sanctions on Russia, this is unlikely to work due to two facts; Putin is fine with everyday Russian citizens taking a financial hit (it’s not as if he has an election to win), and Russian citizens are not motivated by the same things that we are. We, in the west, place a premium on economic comforts. Russians will gladly suffer temporary economic downturn if it means a successful conquest — Iranians will gladly suffer ostracization from the world economic system if it means the demise of Israel — and so on. This mentality insulates them somewhat against sanctions. Germans, remember, will not suffer higher energy prices to defend a country that isn’t even a NATO member. And the European countries in China’s pocket…forget it. Hence, don’t expect much from our allies. Hate to be jingoistic, but the United States *is* the decisive leader of the free world.\n\n5. So what now? Let’s say we seize the assets of high net-worth Russian citizens in the US, place broad-based sanctions on Russia, muscle Germany into cancelling Nord Stream II, etc… The whole nine yards, as it pertains to sanctions. Couple this with a media campaign to attempt to spur dissent within Russia, foreign aid to Ukraine, and a hard militarization of NATO borders in Poland and the Baltics. What will probably happen is a Ukraine forcibly subjugated and partially annexed by Russia, temporary economic pain experienced by Russian citizens and oligarchs alike, some economic pain experienced by our European allies who are dependent on Russia, and a high-profile failure of western action to stifle Russian imperialism. However, short of military intervention in Ukraine (which, given the recent pull-out from Afghanistan and a diminished appetitive for loss of American life, is unrealistic and probably not advisable either), there is little we can do.

A grease trap left by the restaurant previously at that location has spilled fermented burned grease all over the back of the store, creating a significant slipping hazard and releasing ammonia fumes. The people working attempted to contact management to have the store closed and the problem fixed, but management ghosted them, forcing the in store supervisor to make the decision to protect the employees and customers by closing the store.

After this decision, a member of corporate came to the location and insisted we reopen, ignoring the health hazard and the concerns. In response, the workers walked out and began a strike. This is only possible due to the recent unionization of this location, along with the other two Starbucks in Ithaca. The health hazard caused by the grease trap is the last straw for many of the employees, who have been dealing with an abusive and apathetic manager, and many aggressive union busting attempts from corporate itself.

It was reported that Cornell University had to record massive financial losses as a result of the atrocity and will have to petition for a larger endowment. 

The student who received the extra chicken nugget is now being sentenced to three semesters of CHEM 2090 without parole as well as three years of housing in Ganedago Hall, furthest from all fire escapes.

Rather simply notifying a local authorities regarding food safety, or OSHA guidelines seems like that would be a good place to start without going nuclear. That said, it's unclear to what lengths they have gone to solve this issue.\n\nPrincipally, the role of a union is not to wrest power and control from a company for its own sake, but provide an avenue in which employees under its umbrella feel as though they have negotiating agency and a well established line of communication. The problem is if you demonstrate that your union is willing to stop working on a dime and go nuclear for things that might not merit such a response, the company isn't exactly going to be inclined to continue that line of communication. Moreover, we know that this particular Starbucks makes most of its money at two different segments of time in the year, each lasting for 4.5 months. Deciding to impact the most lucrative month (after already having been impacted by covid restrictions) of the first 4.5 months of this year does not bode well in the corporate cost/benefit analysis of maintaining the property. Moreover, we have no idea what the property value/rental costs and operating costs on that Starbucks are... nevermind that a huge competitor (CTB) is closer in proximity to campus and is alot more popular. It's also unclear how the taxing works.\n\n Bottom line, It's a bit disingenuous, I think, to shout union busting when there are many factors that go into this issue and alot of the details aren't freely available.

Cornell University recently announced that they will be ending unlimited storage for Cornell Gmail  accounts. They will be capping all accounts at 5GB total inclusive of Gmail, Drive, Photos, and Docs/Sheets/Slides, with no option for users to pay for added storage. In reality, a 5GB total limit means it will no longer be feasible for Cornellians to use these as their primary accounts. This will force Cornellians to migrate away from Cornell accounts, creating a significant time and logistical burden for tens of thousands of Cornellians, and simultaneously hindering the University's alumni engagement, brand awareness, and fundraising capabilities.

This decision by the University is a result of Google's semi-evil decision to no longer offer free unlimited storage to universities. However, this does not mean that Cornell is forced to reduce all of our accounts to 5GB of storage, rendering them useless. Other universities have negotiated with Google to allow users to keep their university accounts with a 200GB storage cap for a very modest fee.

Forcing Cornellians to migrate their Cornell Gmail accounts to another service will:

1. Waste a massive amount of Cornell student and alumni time
2. Squander the alumni pride and connectedness many of us feel by still using our Cornell emails
3. Hurt Cornell's ability to keep us informed of university news, events, and fundraising
4. Eliminate a massive amount of free marketing the university gets from ppl using Cornell emails
5. Create a huge inconvenience for thousands of Cornellians for years to come

-Tell your CS professor that their teaching methods are “cumbersome and unintuitive”, regardless of how much experience they have in the field. They will admire the bravery it took to speak up, and will appreciate the constructive feedback👨‍💼

-Go to every class wearing a T-Shirt with coffee stains on it. (Engineering students: don’t shower before either - you won’t have time for it.) People will admire your dedication to your studies. 

-Go to the Libe Café in between classes, and make sure to order the most complicated coffee concoction known to man. Bonus points if you’re friends with the barista. People will admire your exquisite taste ☕️

One lone student suggested that working a minimum-wage job would be a great way to relate to the same people that ILRies are claiming to want to advocate for. I couldn't have agreed more.

Many students come from privilege and will never understand what the working-class American goes through (especially lower class or lower-middle class Americans). I've seen a worker get his leg crushed in a machine. I've heard of another within my previous employer's network who was beheaded by a roller system. There are workers in the service industry who are abused daily by rude customers or have even been assaulted.

If an ILRie is looking to advocate for working-class Americans, it's beneficial to work alongside those same people. Otherwise, you will never assist in making the change that you claim you want to see.

Not shitting on privilege. Just shitting on the idea that a person can advocate for the working-class effectively without ever having been a part of their world. ILR is slightly flawed. This should totally be a prerequisite for most students (depending on their chosen path).

North Star, the newly renovated and super nice dining hall with, formerly, tons of open hours probably isn’t meant to be open so little. It and TM probably aren’t supposed to be using nearly all-disposable plates and silverware. They’re not supposed to get overwhelmed with normal traffic.

It’s the same at other eateries too, just generally not enough staff. They’re all hiring, but nobody’s biting, and I can only imagine that’s from a lack of pay.

Consider student positions - minimum wage, barely a bit more if you get promoted and take on tons more responsibilities. From my experience getting promoted can actually be detrimental because of the added work you have to take on. Why deal with that when you can:
- work anywhere else on campus, in arguably much easier and less busy jobs where you can also study, like in gyms and libraries?
- focus on all your super hard classes?
- join a project team or participate in the literal thousands other student organizations Cornell brags about?
- do research?
- literally just not deal with at least 10 hours of minimum wage food service work per week?

I can’t imagine the value proposition is much better for full-time employees. It’s miraculous that Cornell has all this money to renovate and spruce up their dining halls, but not anywhere near as much to staff them, apparently. They sure want more people, but not for more than table scraps.
