I recently got into Harvard and Yale. I can't go to any admit days because of the current global health situation. I would appreciate it if you could allow me to gain a better insight into your institution. (I'm from Dallas, TX if that makes any difference lol).

I intend to do bioengineering/biomedical engineering on a pre-med track and go to medical school after graduation. I want a school with good pre-med experience and generally good advising. I want to be heavily involved in research during undergrad, and I want to be able to form connections with my professors. I just want a campus with friendly faces, with a lot of clubs I can become involved in.

I'm also interested in film and art as hobbies and I have a wide array of interests I'd like to pursue in college. I love to write and that's also something I'd like to do (i.e. I'd like to perhaps get involved at a school publication). I want a school that would allow me to pursue these hobbies as well as allow me to build a solid pre-professional experience.

I really want to know what Harvard's environment is like. Do you feel it is as cutthroat and competitive as many say it is? If someone looks lost on campus, will someone typically approach them to help? Are people friendly? I would appreciate your honest opinions!

Best of luck"", 'score': 36, 'created_utc': 1585406789.0}, {'author': 'Wrkncacnter112', 'body': 'When I was in college, I dated a Yale undergrad and spent a lot of time on campus at Yale for a few years. I later went to Harvard Law School, where I had a job with a lot of Harvard undergrad colleagues. In other words, I did not attend Yale College or Harvard College, but had years of up-close experience with both communities.\n\nThe first thing I would say is that you should attend the school that’s better for what you want to study. They’re both excellent schools, and that should come first. But assuming both are roughly equal in your intended major, or you don’t know what you want to study, read on.\n\nI am from Connecticut, but I have to admit that New Haven is not the greatest city. Cambridge is far, far better, and Boston is also great and very close to Cambridge. No comparison there. Yale feels a bit like a fortress surrounded by an unsympathetic urban landscape. Harvard is in “friendly territory”: a city with about forty colleges and universities in and around it. New Haven isn’t scary or anything. But it’s a bit gritty.\n\nI would say that Yale focuses much more on its undergrad experience than Harvard does. Yale has really excellent facilities for undergrads at the Colleges. They’re little worlds unto themselves. Harvard Houses are also great, and some are very impressive facilities, but they’re not as self-contained. Yale Colleges are bubbles; Harvard Houses are more connected to the surrounding area. Also, Yale Colleges have very strong identity and spirit. Harvard Houses have spirit too, but not to the Yale extent. \n\nIf you were a grad student, I’d say Harvard for sure (all else being equal). But undergrad is really what Yale prides itself on, and it does seem to be a very special experience. Yale undergrads feel like a very elite, special cohort (even if mainly to themselves), even more than Harvard ones do. Yale’s actual campus is much more architecturally beautiful and emotionally engaging (to me, anyway) than Harvard’s, but its surroundings are uglier and less fun. Yale felt like more of a pressure cooker than Harvard; the undergrads are all trying to subtly prove how awesome they are through their impressive activities and clubs, even more than at Harvard. The prevalence of Secret Societies feeds into this. Harvard has Final Clubs, but they are arguably closer to (elite) fraternities than to Secret Societies. I personally think the Secret Societies, though alluring, are mostly a bad thing. But if you want to attend mysterious ancient-seeming rites in a windowless “tomb,” Yale’s the place to do it.\n\nOverall, Harvard is bigger, a tiny bit more relaxed, and more “normal,” in a way. Imagine a large, prestigious university in any medium-sized American city, but just older and more historic and famous, with prestige turned to 10. Yale feels more cloistered, elite, and set-apart, with its neo-gothic courtyards and Parade of Comestibles.

We're protected...most hospitalizations are unvaccinated people. After two years of this hellscape, I'm not sure what more y'all want, and what you think will happen if we lock down again. All that's in our power now is to mask up. This virus is NOT going away. \n\nIdeally, we would have options for people of different comfort levels, some people could do remote, but this is logistically impossible. Furthering the mission of Harvard now outweighs the risk.

The university had about 30 undergraduate cases when nearly everyone—with the exception of a few international students—went home. Those are ridiculous numbers when the university isn\'t even operating at full capacity. The Harvard hotel only has a few hundred hospital beds. If we have a COVID outbreak similar to the one over break, Harvard won\'t even have enough hospital beds to house its students.\n\nI think what\'s inevitably going to happen is that (which the University doesn\'t want to admit) an overwhelming majority of the students are going to get COVID-19 next semester. Once the outbreak occurs, the university will either:\n\n1. Continue in-person learning and just go through it if most cases are asymptomatic and mild.\n2. Stop in-person learning for a few weeks, go remote, and then resume in-person learning later in the semester\n3. Worst-case scenario: go remote for the entirety of the whole semester.\n\nThe reality of the situation is that the rules are nonsensical: if you have COVID, you quarantine in your room for five days. It\'s a sloppy policy that outside of saying you ""may have to adjust your living situation"" doesn\'t even specifically address people who live in doubles. The policy maybe would work if you lived in a single and were extra cautious, but if you and your roommate are sleeping across from each other in the same room and one of you is infected, both of you are going to get COVID.

It mutates every two weeks, with a mutation in Italy resulting in it being up to 10x more contagious then the Wuhan strain.

It’s 11:22 pm on the 31st and I’m unironically sitting in my bed in my dead quiet house while the rest of the world is celebrating New Years’ Eve. It’s not that I didn’t want to party. I just didn’t get invited anywhere. It’s given me even more time to ruminate than was already unhealthy, and now all the bad thoughts are just melting together and really letting me have it.
 
My first semester kind of sucked. I know it wasn’t the worst it possibly could have been, but it sure wasn’t good. Now I know this is pretty normal, but so many things that were bad about it are part of broader problems, and I know they won’t just magically resolve themselves. I feel really angry lately, which is just an intensification of previous, constant feelings of sadness, emptiness, paranoia and self-blame that have stretched back since early in high school. When I have memories about the semester, if I close my eyes and re-envision my state of mind when I had time to think— on those routine walks to/from the dhall, to class, wherever— with minimal exception, I could only ever recall feeling angry, sad, or just nothing. It was constant by around the second week of classes. Feeling nothing but either distinctly bad, or just nothing. Just flat. And that flat feeling wasn’t much better than bad, because it would devolve into bad at the drop of a hat. The same didn’t go for good; something cool could happen, and I could feel relaxed for once, but the bad ruminations and mean inner criticisms would crowd out those feelings so quickly that I look back and hardly remember the good times even happened. By the end of the semester I felt like I was slowly losing my spirit. Just fading into something vaguer and vaguer every day. I felt like who I was there was just some even worse, even less likable version of whatever confused sad thing I was before.

My approach to these feelings this semester was mostly to isolate myself when I got into a really negative spiral, which ended up being pretty often after the first few weeks. I would avoid developing my friendships, not because I didn’t want to have friends, but because despite my efforts to cheer up, it was honestly really, really difficult to not appear cold and dismissive and terse in conversation even though none of that had a single thing to do with the other person. It’s not that I turned into an absolute asshat during those moods, or was explicitly mean, and it’s certainly not that I never talked to people. I really did have a some normal, good days, some great meals where I felt just fine and slipped back into my sort of funny, chill self. It’s just that I didn’t do it enough, and now I’m worried the withdrawn brooding side is all some people might remember. I could have done so much better. I just gave up and withdrew into myself too many times in the dhall or in classes or meetings with my EC. I could have done so much better. Not that I even know how to manage it, but I could have tried harder. I’m really concerned about the long-term effects of that behavior on my future ability to make friends here, because I’m paranoid that people have an image of me as this angry loner. Maybe kind of irrational, maybe not. I’m just angry at myself I let that side come out so often. We’re all people, we all get angry. Come on verisad, you’re supposed to develop methods to control yourself when you’re an adult. I’ve done a shit job with that. I shouldn’t have let it get this out of hand.

I’m just really disgusted with myself. I feel like that’s the best way I could describe it sometimes. Like when I kind of step outside myself, and look inward, I kind of cringe, because ew, look at me. I’m not performing particularly well at school (and know a few of my peers did consistently better, plus were good wholesome people, so the ‘it’s only first semester’ stuff is not really a tenable excuse), I have no friends, my jokes aren’t really that funny, I’m kind of weird and tryhard and awkward. Any people I met in the dhall, at my main EC, that I SHOULD have pursued friendships with, I either only half did, or just didn’t, because I guess I couldn’t deal with the effort of following it up, or just couldn’t reign in my emotions. I’ve even gained fifteen pounds, so when I’m not degrading myself in my head for whatever reason, no worries, I could always just look at my body and be fucking disgusted all over again. I came home thinking maybe being away from Annenberg would help me at least begin shedding the weight, slowly, since we generally don’t keep excess food in the house . . . nope, no change. And too bad the iota of motivation I actually did have to go work out in the beginning of the semester, when I got myself to the gym a few times, has totally burnt out.

I know we all have a mean inner critical voice and this is it talking. But the thing is, I feel like when we tend to say things like ‘don’t listen to the critical inner voice, because it’s irrational,’ my problem with that is that I feel like mine is, actually, pretty ‘rational’. I really do seem to deserve some, if not most, of the self-criticism. My personality is lacking somewhere. Not to make this about logic or anything, but it’s the inference to the best explanation. Take the real-life evidence, I don’t have friends. I’m not getting hit up. Never dated anyone. I’m a lonely person. I am capable of being outgoing and somewhat funny, but somewhere along the way the motor just burns out and somehow I can’t make and keep friends. I’m not extremely desirable friend or partner material, and I am doing this to myself, and am not getting better at not doing it to myself. 

I know it can change. Anything can change. It could get better, sure. Then it could get worse again. I told myself that things would change for the better in high school, and senior year — forget it, after Dec. 13th I thought I was holding that golden ticket, finally on my way to feeling ‘normal’ and fulfilled and with my own crowd. I remember the fever of the holidays. I binged the housing day videos when they came out, memorized all the flags and mascots. I watched that Adams rap video one in awe, feeling all fuzzy, like I was in on this special inside joke now. Well surprise, reversal of fortune, now who even knows if I’ll have a blocking group. I’ll have less than a month to figure it out. I just wish I gave it a little more effort. I couldn’t just suck it up and get back on the horse. That’s what life is about, getting back on the horse. And I couldn’t do it, and I don't know how to get better at doing it. I wish I could sorry to any person I was ever unfairly dismissive toward. I just want them to know how sorry I am, and that it wasn't their fault. It's also absolutely awful to consider the possibility that I could have contributed to even more bad feelings in others when I acted like that, and just continued the cycle and made it worse for everyone and helped screw over the aggregate pleasure, even if just a little. If anyone our there ever had someone just act mad around you for no reason, I'm sorry on their behalf. Maybe it was me. You didn't deserve that.

If anyone else had similar feelings first semester and wants to share any insight, I would really appreciate it. I'm currently talking to someone at CAMHS, and having some sort of evaluation soon where I guess they determine whether I should get on meds. That's kind of worrisome in its own right because my parents' divorce is leaving my mom in a really awful financial situation, and getting outside treatment is costly and I don't even want to think about stressing her out more, but we'll see. If anyone found other ways of coping that helped in the first year, it would mean a lot. 

I’m sorry this was a dump. If it’s too rambling, I’m sorry, delete it, or I will. I know it’s like anything else we all see and hear about here, but I seriously have nowhere else to put down these feelings. I hope everyone on this sub has a great New Years. You all work so hard and deserve the best. Whoever you are, I seriously hope you could find some solace from whatever you’re going through right now. I’m sure we could all use that right now.

I'm a depressed as fuck senior taking ec50 because I have to. My motivation and general ability to function are 0, I can't feel any pleasure or drive whatsoever, and I barely make out of bed every day to drag my ass to required classes. I have something between depression, diagnosed PTSD and probable ADD

Ec50 has been bad. It's a lot of work when you have no friends in the class, so you have nobody to work with on the labs like most people do. I keep trying to get myself to OH, but can't get over the deep fear and embarrassment I'll feel when I show up and these TFs, who are my peers and younger, will (as I can't help imagining) laugh at me in their heads seeing that I know jack shit and shouldn't be at Harvard n stuff

I did bad on the midterm and bad on empirical proj part 1 because I didn't know it was due until the day it was due. (I entered the class about 2.5 weeks into the term and managed to just miss reminders about the deadline). When I realized the deadline I managed to work at it for a few hours in a frenzy and ended up with about half credit

My lab credit aside from that ^ is O.K... I did fine on most of the previous ones and have all the attendance points. Not submitting anything for the one due in a couple hours because even when I muster the ability to stop staring at the wall long enough to look at the screen, I can't look at the questions without my vision blurring or without floundering on Stata until my 0 drive gets to negative drive and I give up.  It's only what 3 points so I really can't make myself do it

I have the guest lecture attendance points

I plan to work really hard on project part 2 and study really hard for the final

I know most posts here are bored happy '27 high schoolers asking the big questions, like what the weather's like in Boston, but figured I'd see if there are any alums that can come out of the woodwork and share how hard I'll have to grind to pass 

So anyone know what the grading is like? Is there inflation? Is it curved down, ie should I kill myself?* How likely are they to fail me? I don't give a shit what I get as long as it's not a D

Harvard recreation reduced hours and now I can't go to the gym at all!

MAC is the only gym open in the afternoon and the only gym that has showers, but it is CROWDED all the time (I've tried 10am, 12pm, 2-3pm, 5-8pm is just hell).  They put a picture on the door with ""MAC usage rates"" last week, so I assume that I'm not the only one unhappy with the situation. This picture is just not true, this data is from last AY and not from this summer! Also there are just fans and no central AC in the basement where the machines are.

Hemenway is open till 2pm. So if I go there, the only option is before work. But Hemenway has no showers.
Murr center is lovely and never crowded, open till 3pm, but has no showers either. Same problem. 
I even went to Quad, but the showers there STINK and the locker rooms are disgusting, I didn't dare to use them. 

And here am I, a grad student who works on campus every day and desperately needs the gym for my back pain caused by my sedentary work. How am I supposed to fit workouts into my schedule? Quad is out, MAC is out. When I go to MAC, 3 times out of 5 I just see the crowds and leave right away.

He captivates the audience. \n\nI did get some cool nuggets from his lectures and I think he does have a high level roadmap when presenting, but half the time it feels like he is riffing off himself if you listen more closely. Students would ask questions and he’d give a long winded response that half answered the question, give up, and end in a question back at them.

After an extremely ugly public pissing match, West chose to give up tenure and stomp off to Princeton, where he had tenure.\n\nHe's also had tenure at Union Theological Seminary and at Yale. For most academics, tenure represents a long-term commitment if not a lifetime one to an educational institution and to research. It's a great prize. Why does West keep leaving? People leave tenured positions on occasion for other positions, but not nearly as frequently as he does.

Harvard offered him a non-tenured position. He accepted it on those terms. Then when they refused to treat it as a tenure-track position he got into a huff about that. Suddenly, he says he's being denied consideration because he supports Palestinians.  I also understand he hasn't produced a lot of meaningful scholarship recently.

19,p4bzma,toadbro,72.0,0.94,20,Harvard,"Recently, the discord that is associated with this subreddit has gone through some major changes. In short, the members of the discord have completely migrated over to a new discord with the previous mods as the owners.

Why did the members decide to change discords? As another [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/p3c2y9/wrong_discord_on_subreddit_sidebar/) mentions, this was due to issues with the ownership. The specific issues were summarized in that thread, but the thread was locked before other members could elaborate on the details. The owner was never present, took credit for the work the two main admins did, and refused to transfer ownership even after a vote among the moderators on discord. This server was massive, highly active, and a crucial social hub especially during the pandemic, but almost nobody knew who the owner was. In fact, the owner had as little as 13 messages in the server over several years. This all got intense over the last couple of months as the owner ghosted all of the members, including the admins.

Now, this all just seems like isolated discord drama. This directly relates to the subreddit as the owner and one other admin are the major moderators of this subreddit. Even though the new [discord server](https://discord.gg/invite/harvard) is the only active one of the two, the owner of the other discord server changed the link on the subreddit to redirect to their server rather than the active one.

All of these problems are a result of the moderation teams on both the previous discord and the current subreddit. The top moderators are not Harvard affiliated anymore and have been the main power holders for an extended period of time. We would not be opposed to the idea of alumni as moderators, but these particular moderators have shown no interest in being a part of the communities they are moderating and should pass off their roles to active members of the communities.

Perhaps instead of locking threads with questions and ghosting us more, you can take some time and answer them directly. Also, there is still a link to the discord on the subreddit.

29,ija9di,throwawayharvard2021,84.0,0.91,22,Harvard,"Hello. Throwaway here.

I'm sure many of you remember the [Harvard Meme Scandal of 2017](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2017/6/5/2021-offers-rescinded-memes/). Either the rescinded students came years after you, they were your potential classmates, or they served as a warning to use social media wisely when it came time for you to apply to college.

Fast forward to today. I, like many other folks on this thread, receive a smattering of strange Facebook messages from people all around the world. Last night, I was going through my  message requests and somehow ended up in the ""hidden messages"" tab (new Facebook is a pain). There, behold, lay all of the chats I had ever joined and then left, including ""Harvard memes for horny bourgeois teens"". I, like many of you, had joined this chat back when it was named something else, and was innocent and silly. As soon I realized the chat had turned dark and offensive, I left it immediately. However, because I don't live on Facebook, this was at least several hours after the most egregious content began flowing in. (""Harvard memes for horny bourgeois teens"" was a precursor group chat for an ""edgy"" meme chat. If you wanted to join the ""edgy"" chat, you had to post something suitably offensive in ""horny bourgeois teens"", and the people in the ""edgy"" chat would let you in. Obviously I never posted anything myself and I never joined the ""edgy"" chat, but there was plenty of horrible content  in ""horny bourgeois teens"" alone, and this chat was likely what was reported to admissions.) I had no idea I still had access to these messages, three years after leaving the chat, so I began to look at them.

Here's where it gets interesting. By briefly looking at the Facebook profiles of students who sent the offensive memes (assuming they are among the students who were ultimately rescinded), I learned that they were now mostly rising juniors at schools including Stanford, Brown, UC Berkeley, Washington University at St. Louis, and Carnegie Mellon. Obviously, these are some of the top schools in our nation. I had many thoughts upon seeing that, although these students had their admission withdrawn from Harvard for posting (and making) memes that were racist, sexist, anti-Semitic, etc., they were seemingly able to move onto equally prestigious schools with no penalties, apart from having to wait until the next admissions cycle to apply.  When I looked at the website of one rescinded student, he claimed he took a gap year to work on an extracurricular project (I'm being vague here). Additionally, and honestly most critically, at least one (white) student who had sent an offensive racial meme appears to be a current student at Harvard (in my class)!

Of course, the Harvard scandal was in 2017. In the years since (and in the past couple months alone) many other students have faced similar consequences for their social media posts. Just a few days ago, the past caught up with this doctor who lied about the reason she was forced to [leave her first residency program](https://www.cleveland.com/healthfit/2020/08/former-cleveland-clinic-residents-training-certificate-revoked-over-anti-semitic-social-media-comments.html). She was dismissed because she made anti-Semitic tweets, but she didn't tell the second residency program that. Of course, when it inevitably found out, the second program kicked her out and she has now lost her medical license. The circumstances surrounding her case are different (her tweets were public, and directly related to medical care) but arguably relevant to the Harvard situation.

For a disclaimer: I have no interest in doxxing or exposing these students (I will just say, after some Googling, that there is some potential tea here). I simply thought that it would be interesting to have a conversation about what happened, three years later, and discuss what moving on from such a mistake, if you will call it that, should look like. Should students have to tell other colleges if they were rescinded from another college, like they must report disciplinary incidents or acts of academic dishonesty from high school?

I'll add that the MO of more recent ""doxxers"" appears to be exposing students publicly. See [these cases](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/us/racism-social-media-college-admissions.html) for example, in which the students' names were published in multiple news outlets. However, the identities of the rescinded Harvard students have, to my knowledge, never been exposed or released in any manner (one student gave a NPR interview about the scandal using his first name only). So while a student rescinded from college in 2020 due to a racist meme is likely going to have his or name plastered all over the Internet, this did not happen to any of these students.

I'm curious to hear what members of this community think.","[{'author': 'pinkstardust007', 'body': 'I know who three of those people are, but I was never in that group. I was in another group though and I remember just watching the drama unfold and asking myself how those idiots got into Harvard in the first place.

Today\'s cancel culture is brutal and everything is set in stone, or on Twitter. No matter how much a person apologizes and how hard they commit to changing themselves, very few people will see it as genuine and their name will forever be tied to something moronic they said online. Although change and education should be something you do for yourself, not for the sake of restoring your reputation, clearing your name is still important for any future endeavors. Harvard was absolutely right to cut ties with them, I supported that decision back then and I support it now, just like I support the anonymity of those involved. \n\nDon\'t get me wrong, being 17 doesn\'t excuse their behavior, especially in today\'s world. But I think it\'s okay that they got to move on, all we can do now is hope that being told to fuck off by Harvard was a learning experience.

i know i can’t control people’s opinions of me and there could be literally any random reason (and i’m also not rich or white), but after getting rejected from almost all of Harvard’s RSOs both years i feel like i must be doing something wrong / i’m just really not “cool” enough.

Spending four years at Harvard was definitely a hard time for me. I just graduated in June, and ever since then it feels like a weight has slowly been lifted off of me and I've rediscovered what it's like to be a happy, confident, curious and creative person. Some background: I came from a very good highschool in the Midwest that I was lucky to be in (got in on a scholarship) which I did very well in and excelled academically and extracurricular, as well as having a large group of close friends I cared deeply about and actually enjoying my classes and sports and plays and everything i did. There were miserable moments sure, I had depression then like I do now, but in general the good outweighed the bad. 
Then i got into Harvard, and you know the drill. It was extremely exciting, I spent the rest of my senior year and summer thinking I had the rest of my life made and I was going to have such an amazing experience and go on to change the world. 

But here's what I've come to remember about Harvard. The classes are really badly taught, my highschool teachers were way better. I've heard that's true in other places too, I just didn't expect it. The very best teachers were not professors, they were the preceptors ie gen-ed section leaders or language teachers. The professors were worth jack shit. The best professor I had was mediocre. I was engineering, and I know it's a developing program, but still. They either read aloud something they wrote years ago in a monotone voice, but of course dock your grade if you don't show up ever class to see them do it. They tell you to look things up on wikipedia because they can't be bothered to explain it, or say ""You're a Harvard student, you should be able to figure it out"" YES I KNOW I'M A HARVARD STUDENT. That doesn't mean I'm Mozart. Some are so socially inept it's like pulling teeth to talk to them sometimes. These are the amazing nobel prize winners I'm supposed to be forming relationships with and learning from, but they can barely hold casual conversation about their own subject, much less anything else. 

Ok moving on. The students. Now, I've met some close friends at harvard to be sure. I never expected to be casual friends or even acquaintances with everyone at Harvard. I didn't expect such an overwhelming attitude of ""If you're not useful to me, then I can't bother to talk to you"". The cliquish nature is amazing. Every club I tried to join, even one I was in for 3 years, at the end I realized only a few members would actually talk to me. Most people couldn't bother to remember my name. That was kind of a general theme, no one remembers your name. Obviously the final clubs are a great example of the exclusivity of the place, I know part of the appeal of those places is that they are ""better"" than me which is why they got in, so why acknowledge me when we pass in the dhall. But it extends beyond that to every social stereotype in harvard. Even I did it several times I'm sure. You are just so alone. Almost no one cares about you. They'll come if you're popular and attractive and they want something out of you. Could be they want sex or connections to other people or they think you'll be successful or might share your pset answers, but they won't help a friend otherwise. 
They say - ""Sorry, last minute studying"" 
me - Yeah, sure, enjoy those youtube videos and netflix series. 

I had friends who weren't like that, for sure, but in highschool there was an sense that even if not everyone knew your name, what you were about, enough did that you felt part of a community. I was not part of the Harvard community, and I don't care if they call me an alumnus, I'm still not today. I'll use the certificate to help me through life, but that's it. Harvard was not my home.

So on a more positive note, I'm out of Harvard with a job I'm happy with. I'm sure the degree helped (although I'm not so sure), so I'm grateful for that. I've noticed such a change in my outlook, wellbeing, and happiness. I  feel so much smarter for one. I was starting to feel like an incapable dunce compared to everyone, so it's nice to not feel bad for taking longer to understand something. I'm more curious, since I'm not overloaded with assignments and badly taught/written essays on subjects that were never that interesting to begin with. I can pick and choose what I want to study and how to study and I really do enjoy it. I read articles on newspapers, learn from courses provided by my job, practice coding online, even self studying organic chemistry for fun. I feel accepted. I've only met a fraction of the people at my job, who's workforce is about the size of mather and dunster combined, but the many people I've met have been so welcoming it's like the whole company is so excited to have me. They care about who I am because they respect me as a new employee who they might be working with for a while, and a lot of them don't know anything about harvard. btw, I'm not the type to lie about where I went to school or say ""boston"", but I'll avoid it if it doesn't come up. Anyways, things are better now

A few more things: 
I hate that I can't be proud of where I went to school. Why does some jock that went to a state school get to shout the name loud and proud and noone thinks much of it, but I can't? Is that all in my head? I definitely get the sense from people that 
1 They're jealous of me
or they think
2. I'm a lucky spoiled liberal
3. I'm a super mega genius child prodigy
4 My family own's a yacht
5 Nothing much at all which is the best option

The dhall food is fine, find something else to make small talk about or cook your own meals
Some students don't consider that not everyone's parents can send them stipends every month. Some of us have to work jobs, and to be honest it kind of sucks balancing with 5 classes. So be a little sympathetic when a student says ""I don't know, that restaurant is really expensive""

Networking is a fine thing, it's just building weak personal relationships with people who you might do work with some day or get a job from, but it doesn't have to govern your every waking moment. Get to know someone who's of no use to you.

Chinese tourists need to get out of the way. Harvard should not let them in the yard or class areas. I never wanted to feel like an actor at Disneyland everyday instead of a college student, and I wouldn't have signed up for that. We don't need more media attention as far as I know, so why let them take pictures of freshman guys changing on the first floor. (Speaking of which, where are the gender equality groups on campus when it comes to that little bit of discrimination?)

Ok I should sleep. Peace Harvard, maybe I'll learn to love you someday.

Classics, linguistics, anthropology, music, German (yes, the professors, too!), and history also all have amazing professors (their names done all come to mind at the moment) from whom I had the privilege of taking classes.

First, obviously Math 55 catches my attention and I would like to take it but I wonder if it might be too overwhelming for my first year. Does anyone have any insight into the workload for that class? If I am eventually going to be introduced to, in other math classes, all of the topics covered in this one class, I don't see it as beneficial to me to suffer through an accelerated class that throws it all at me at once. Can I learn all the topics covered in Math 55 through other math courses at Harvard spread across my undergraduate curriculum?


Second, is it common for undergraduate math students to remain at Harvard for their PhD studies as well? I am very interested in the work of one of the professors at Harvard on computational number theory. I was thinking I would like to study under him for my future PhD.

I was recently admitted to the MS in Data Science program, and I wanted to ask for some advice.

For some background, I just finished my UG in applied math and I intend to pursue a PhD in either statistics or computer science eventually to do statistical/machine learning research. I have applied to a few PhD programs this cycle, but have yet to hear back from them.

I would like to get as much research experience as possible in order to prepare for doctoral research, so I was wondering if it makes sense to use this program as a stepping stone to a PhD. I see that students may complete a thesis to satisfy degree requirements, which is exciting as I would be able to work with a great lab or faculty.

What concerns me about this program, however, is that it's a degree in data science - which, from what I have gathered, is seen as a cash grab degree and inferior to a training purely in statistics or computer science. I also see that the curriculum is flexible outside of the five required data science courses and that I may choose to take somewhat rigorous elective courses. Would it make sense, then, to attend this program over other more rigorous MS programs in either stats or cs?

I would love to hear anyone's experience in this program and their thoughts on this.

It's the (supposedly) all-important junior summer, and I have nothing to do. But to be honest, I'm kind of okay with it. 

I think rejection stories are extremely important to share. I don't think we hear about them at Harvard as much as we should, but there's beauty in vulnerability. I started applying to summer internships several months ago. I even made it to the third round of interviews at my dream internship, and the company didn't even have the courtesy to let me know I was rejected. I had to ask them. After the onslaught of rejection letters sent to my inbox, I even began applying to random, mostly unpaid internships I found on Indeed, and I didn't get those either. I even applied to sell books at Barnes & Noble and I didn't get that too! And that was supposed to be Plan C.

But I want people to know that it's okay to get rejected. It totally happens. Rejection is not a reflection of your qualifications and self-worth. I do believe there's beauty in doing nothing, and I'm going to spend the summer entertaining myself and achieving my personal goals. I have every intention of sitting on my behind and watching 19+ seasons of Million Dollar Listing. I also want to get in shape and finally read the books on my bucket list that I haven't been able to because of schoolwork. Every time you get rejected from something, you can focus on something that you chose to do and what's truly meaningful to you. I like to think of it this way: I don't have to slave over a task delegated to me by a superior. This summer, I'm charting my own path.

My family is pretty upset about all the nothing I'm doing, and I'm not really sure how to address that. They have high expectations. But I have to say, I'm semi-happy with how my summer is going. Sure, it's cool that my peers are doing internships at Facebook, Google, and L'Oréal. But I also think it's really important to cast rejection in a positive light. You own the time that you've been given. You're free to define the hours as you see fit. I hate waking up at the crack of dawn, and now I can spend my time sleeping until the early afternoon. I hate commuting, and I've gained back three hours of time I would've spent commuting roundtrip. 

I don't really know how to conclude this post, but I just wanted to share that rejection happens to Harvard students and it's totally okay: cast that rejection in a positive light.","[{'author': 'Shuddahailup', 'body': 'If you’re in NYC, I’ll try to get you an internship with an educational nonprofit.

**Questions for Discussion**

(1) Do you believe the admissions lawsuit has emboldened students and other organizations to sue Harvard?

(2) Who's right in this debate? Should Harvard have the right to set its own policies because they're a private institution? Does the sanctions policy violate the constitutionality of freedom of association? 

**My Thoughts**

(1) Harvard doesn't ban students from joining single-gender social organizations, but they won't endorse you for leadership positions, athletic team captaincies, and endorsement for prestigious scholarships. I'm not a lawyer, but I suppose a good defense would be that students technically do still have the freedom to associate. They just don't have the college's institutional backing.

(2) Somehow, the feminist argument doesn't sit right with me. I don't feel that *not* being a part of a women's group would forbid you from embracing womanhood and celebrating sisterhood. I feel like you can do that beyond the realm of a sorority.

You have male clubs and female clubs - is there inequality between them due to practical constraints (ie the cost of real estate for a house)? Absolutely, but i certainly don’t think the solution to this inequality is banning or throttling club membership.\n\n\nI think Harvard will probably win any lawsuits on this front, but I don’t think it’ll win Harvard anything tangible.

And I did too, as a student, which is specifically why I went back and became a tutor. What’s happening is not that your options are narrowing, it’s that those fields you mention (plus academia, law school, and maybe teaching) attract the most Harvard students due to a combination of prestige, compensation, interestingness, ability to keep your options open for later career changes, and simply the amount of money those companies can afford to spend on showing up to Harvard recruiting events. Some of those reasons are valid and some totally suck. But the real world of options is very broad!  \n\nSo here’s what you should do as a sophomore and beyond.  A 3-pronged strategy, all related:\n\n1. Test career hypotheses. Think about what fits in the center of the Venn diagram between what you like and what you’re good at, and keep pursing it and gaining expertise and trying it out. Could be lots of different things. Form a hypothesis based on your interests and skills, like “maybe I would like doing x because I enjoy team environments and engineering puzzles,” and figure out ways to test it experimentally: through a project, a class, an internship, even an informational interview with an alumnus (try emailing them with a really short “can we have a call” email, you’ll get a really high response rate compared to cold emails out in the world!) or shadowing them for a day. Etc. Different experiments have different levels of fidelity and that’s OK. As long as you’re learning, you’re making progress!\n\n2. Proactively learn more about what’s out there, to counteract the “OCS Effect” you’re currently experiencing. This can happen naturally through #1 but it’s also good to do things like: look through the alumni database in no particular order, to get a sense of what alumni’s actual distribution of jobs are. Read the OCS data on that and look through the diverse long tail of career paths that aren’t the Big 5 or whatever, and dig in on what some of them are. Get an alumnus to lend you their 5- or 10-year Reunion Red Book with classmates’ updates to each other on what their life has been like since graduation. \n\n3. Actively open yourself up to serendipity. This sounds goofy but in reality a large fraction of job offers come through luck rather than the standard codified processes. Create that luck by: going up to talk to your professor after class when there’s something that piques your interest. Signing up for the clubs and email lists for both Harvard and MIT or other local schools on subjects you’re interested in, and when an event catches your eye, show up, and engage with the speaker afterwards in person. (Post-COVID of course). Submit to the mind-numbing haystack that is career fairs - just go, and read through the lists of companies, because you only need one to catch your eye and work out, even if it means going through hundreds.

Some have in-suite bathrooms (e.g., Wigglesworth) while others have hallway bathrooms (e.g., Canaday).

57,pgozep,shawtzb,53.0,0.91,13,Harvard,"So, I was able to view my file today and I just thought it was really interesting.

I’m not officially supposed to record/mention any specific details or exact quotes so I’m not gonna do any of that but just give a general gist…

Basically both of my readers said that while I was a nice, caring, and empathetic person who had consistent school support I guess from my letter of recs and made note of my experience as a manager in a store along with my marching band experience, they basically said I had nothing distinguishing about myself and that they’re unsure about my strength with regards to the entire applicant pool which lowkey stung. They said that they wanted to see an interview report and compare me with the “full pool” to be I guess more sure of my file/using it as a guiding reference for as to whether I should get in or not. For further reference, I was deferred and then admitted.

My interview report was actually very kind and he ranked me really high (1- in personality, 2+ in academics) so ultimately I think that really helped my case? He wrote a lot of detailed notes about what we talked about and picked up on really small details that actually made me pretty happy that he remembered. 

I mean, I had a very mediocre high school experience and never really planned on applying to an Ivy League so it was as expected. But at the same time the “nothing distinguishing” comment and the fact that they ranked me a 3+ overall, which was also weird cause they ranked me 2 in academics, 2 in personality, 4 in athletics, and 2- in EC, makes me feel like I could’ve easily been rejected and just thrown to the side if just one small thing had changed .

I know that they obviously don’t make mistakes and in the end I’m very happy to be here, but idk some of their comments lowkey kinda hurt and also the fact that 3+ are admitted somewhere at 7-9% makes me feel like I just barely made it in :/ I’ll get over it but yeah bleh just needed to rant","[{'author': 'haltheincandescent', 'body': 'I don\'t know if this will help but: first, I was rejected from Harvard (and Yale and Hopkins) for undergrad. I always did well through high school, and that first time being rejected from something I really wanted hurt. But I also went to another good school, and I learned a lot - and now I\'m at Harvard for grad school. Which is one way of saying that the outcome of undergrad admissions doesn\'t really say anything about what you\'re going to accomplish in the years after that. Presumably I didn\'t get a very good Harvard Score. That is what it is. I\'m still doing fine.\n\nMaybe a more helpful way of thinking about it is also this: in the time I\'ve now been a TF/Phd student here, I\'ve learned more about the way things like admissions works - and it\'s not exactly pretty. Even just reading applications for a particular *course*\\--not even for the university, just one class!--was really weird! Way more people submitted applications than we could have accepted, and almost all of them were stellar. Anyone probably would have succeeded in the class. But we could only admit so many students, so we had to somehow make choices--based on just a few paragraphs worth of an application. Getting from 150 applications to 100 students meant all kinds of hair-splitting and scoring and quick judgement calls based on what was ultimately not that much information. And you know what: some of the students who ""scored"" highest kind of struggled. And some of those who got admitted off the wait list turned out to be the strongest students. I won\'t say that the process was totally arbitrary--but the sense that you get of a student based on an application isn\'t always an accurate sense of who that student is. Sometimes you get the wrong read; sometimes things that actually don\'t say anything about a student\'s ability to succeed become determining factors, just because you have to find *some reason* to justify making the choice you do. For better or worse.\n\nAnd that\'s true of the bigger admissions process, too. The image a committee got of you from an application isn\'t going to be accurate. It just isn\'t. All those scores really say is how the things you wrote (which, by the way, are *not*  ""you""; they\'re just things you wrote at a particular moment) fit into the template of a ""Harvard student,"" based on how the handful of people who read your application read it.

66,jr4je3,road_bagels,21.0,0.84,11,Harvard,"Hi Harvard folk,

I was introduced to my ancestry this summer and I came to learn many interesting things, one of which being that there was a lineage of Harvard and Yale graduates. This was indeed a long time ago; the first of my ancestors to graduate Harvard was in 1693, followed by two of his sons in 1722 and 1725, and one graduating Yale in 1735. In addition, there was also a very close association between my family and the first overseer of Harvard that spans from the founding of the college in 1636. I came to discover this information through various published accounts of New England's history.

My ancestors later emigrated and founded a town in Canada sometime amidst the American Revolution. Growing up, no one in my family ever taught me about the storyline of our ancestry. I suspect that they, for the most part, had no knowledge of any of this. My family did and still does have traditions around being loyal Bruins and Red Sox fans, although for reasons they never quite knew why.

While I am not looking to be admitted into either of these schools, I was wondering what legacy implications there could be for my children in the future if they were to choose to pursue studies at either of these institutions. When one declares legacy, is there space to expand on such lineage or is it simply a yes/no box that's ticked? Is legacy only valid if it is related to the school that one's parent(s) attended?

Hoping to receive some perspective on this matter from the current Harvard community.

Many thanks for taking the time to read.","[{'author': 'skieurope12', 'body': 'Each college defines legacy as it sees fit.

Adams was the “art house” where everyone wore black and smoked all the time saying “if hierarchy presupposes sameness…” and such. We had shirts that said things like “all my other clothes are black” or “we’re all gay and we’re coming to get you”. This is what made Adams of interest to a _Times_ reporter doing a story on PC.\n\nNaturally, Adams wasn’t really like that, but the “leader” made an announcement at dinner, telling everyone when the reporter was coming and suggested we all crank up the stereotypes to eleven.\n\nSo, the night the reporter shows up, the place is just a sea of black clothes and cigarette smoke (smoking in the dining hall officially got killed around this time, but no one cared that particular evening) and gender bending and pretension.\n\nI never saw the reporter up close that night, but I’m told at the start he sort of was looking around in surprise, with a “my God, it’s all true” sort of vibe.

For months before this, students had been asking for the disposable waxed paper cups used as the only cups in the dining halls to be replaced with reusable glasses (the stereotypes are never _entirely_ wrong). By coincidence, that night happened to be the first night where reusable glasses showed up, and some student called for attention and announced this. Normally, this would have gotten some applause, but we were in full stereotype mode, so the place went nuts, with standing ovations, teary hugs, and so on.\n\nMore importantly, it triggered a litany of more interruptions with increasingly ridiculous, PC-friendly proclamations. I recall singing, at one point. By the end, I remember one guy standing up and saying “You know… there’s a lot of love in this room. I think… we should all hug”, triggering a hug-fest of Biblical proportions.\n\nBy now, of course, the reporter knew he’d been had. He bailed at some point. He did write the PC article, but shockingly made no mention of us.

A lot of people care about social climbing yet simultaneously lack actual social skills. You know, the kind that help you make real friends.

96,fhi4x4,montym,25.0,0.88,4,Harvard,"Hello friends,

Harvard's history is marked with numerous occasions when crisis lead to momentous change for the University's constituent schools. The most notable of these events for the purpose of my post is how Radcliffe Women began attending lectures with men only when male attendance dropped during the Second World War. Now is such a moment for the Extension School. 

Once we have contained or survived the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus (and we will survive), all members of the Harvard community should note how much of a resource the Extension School is for the entire university. Not only has it be tacitly (and intently) preparing for widespread distance education for generations, it also provides the University with insight and a diversity of perspectives the University would not have otherwise. 

Furthermore, HES reaches some of the poorest, and most disadvantaged people affiliated with the University. Presidents Faust and Bacow have discussed how Harvard needs to use its ""greatness"" to do more ""good"". Well... HES has been at the forefront of this goal since 1909.

While most people in r/Harvard may demand for the ""In Extension Studies"" tag to be removed from diplomas, I suggest 3 other reforms that will integrate HES more with the broader Harvard community.

1) Open University Apartment Housing up to HES degree students, at least undergrads. Students in Columbia's undergraduate parallel to HES, the School of General Studies (GS), are allowed to enter the housing lottery for their version of University Apartment Housing.

2) Allow HES degree candidates to enroll directly for all FAS classes (prerequisites permitting). Again, Columbia already does this which results in more veterans, mothers, minorities, and professional artists in their classes.

3) Seek donations for (or just build with the \~$40B endowment) a ""House"" for extension programs. This house can rent out rooms to students visiting for on-campus weekends, or to full time students taking all their courses on-campus. It also would give the Extension School a more visible presence on campus, and a new permanent home for a revived Grossman Library. (As an urban planner, I think the Church St. parking lot would be a great place for an ""Extension House"".)

I hope some of you agree with this assessment. Harvard's response to the coronavirus opens a door for HES to ascend to a place within the University it already should hold. I encourage everyone to email the school, the University, and any professor they know to highlight the importance of the Extension School for the entire University. The coronavirus may linger, but it will become old news as quickly as it became a pandemic. Its legacy must be used to improve the University, and one way this can be accomplished is to support the Extension School, and its degree students as much as any other degree candidate.","[{'author': 'None', 'body': '>1) Open University Apartment Housing up to HES degree students, at least undergrads.

&#x200B;

(1) Fact: Asian-Americans do get admitted at [significantly lower](https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/640-width/images/print-edition/20180623_USC932_0.png) rate than other minorities. Neither side disagrees on this.

&#x200B;

(2) Fact: Both sides used the same data sets to achieve their separate conclusions (led by Prof. Card for the defense and Prof.  Arcidiacono for the plaintiffs.) More on this later.

&#x200B;

(3) Fact: Asian-Americans get lower personality scores (specifically ""likability"" ratings) by admission officers who have not met them but know their race.

&#x200B;

(4) Fact: The only area. Only area- that Asian-Americans trail any other race is on the personality section. Thus if asian americans are not discriminated against, they must have worse personalities. But Harvard has both denied that asians are discriminated against or that they have worse personalities. Harvard has given NO explanation for why asians are admitted at lower rates.

&#x200B;

(5) Fact: Supreme court precedent, and the fate of nearly $600 million/year in federal funds to Harvard, prevents Harvard from admitting to race quotas. Yet, the % composition of asians (as well as other races), each year, has remained remarkably constant for over a decade. A statistical anomaly.

&#x200B;

(6) Fact: Using the same data sets, only the plaintiffs have adjusted for the effect of legacies, athletes, and other preferential admissions.  Meaning, asians are not admitted at lower rates because they are less likely be to legacies or athletes.

&#x200B;

The most important is #6 as that is an incorrect explanation seen around here a lot.

A non-trivial amount of logistical planning is necessary to cross-register in a non-intrusive way. Altogether, I recommend you choose a school based on social fit and your financial situation."", 'score': 5, 'created_utc': 1586377891.0}, {'author': 'crharvard', 'body': 'As a senior, I would echo everyone else\'s comments that you should take into account other aspects of college. Personally, although looking back Harvard wasn\'t the best school for me among the options I had (I got interested in CS and EE during college, but I do not like SEAS here), I did not want to attend MIT because I didn\'t identify with the overly geeky/nerdy culture, and I wanted more academic diversity in the student body. I also really like the house community here, and I think it makes for a much more enriching social experience. So all in all, socially, I think Harvard trumps MIT for my taste. But seeing as you\'re the type to apply and get into MIT in the first place, maybe the MIT community is just what you\'re looking for.\n\nAcademically, to me the situation depends on how much you\'re invested in studying CS. I think no one would disagree that MIT is a better school than Harvard for CS. The CS department at Harvard has really talented faculty doing great research, but I don\'t think they have their undergrad pedagogy really figured out. Many of the courses are notoriously poorly taught, and the elective offerings are few and far between. Additionally, the department is heavily bent toward CS theory at the expense of programming, and a lot of my friends and I have had to look toward other resources (projects, internships, online classes) to hone our programming skills. MIT is great at both theory and the practical parts of CS, and they have elective offerings that span all areas of CS. (you\'ll never hear about MIT students cross registering at Harvard for a CS class --  why would they? lol)\n\nLike u/Willing_Breadfruit mentioned, I also think that a lot of the Harvard CS classes are harder than the MIT ones (but not better!). So I don\'t think it\'s necessarily true that by choosing Harvard you\'re gonna have an easier time with your courses; quite the contrary in many cases. One major difference is that MIT\'s majors have a higher number of course requirements than do Harvard\'s. But Harvard CS courses tend to pack a lot more material per class than MIT, so overall, it probably evens out as far as the total work you have to do. But I think MIT\'s more spaced out degree plans give you some more breathing room, as well as a chance to do well in more courses and give yourself more time for certain subjects by spacing them out across multiple semesters. But on the other hand, Harvard is more generous with grades (people *rarely* ever straight up fail classes here, whereas at MIT there\'s a non-trivial amount). Additionally, because the CS degree here has fewer total requirements, you\'ll have more room in your schedule to take whatever elective courses you want outside of CS. \n\nYou mention you\'re just leaning toward CS, so Harvard could definitely be better for other interests, especially if you have interests in non-STEM fields. You should let us know what your other interests are, and, as I said above, what social climates you think you might prefer. If you came here telling us that you wanted to focus solely on CS, and academics was the most important thing to you above everything else, I\'d tell you to go to MIT. So more information is needed here, IMO.\n\nP.S.: You don\'t need to be an awesome programmer to major in CS, anywhere! I didn\'t program before coming to college. But of course, I\'d recommend you spend time getting better at it, as it\'ll only help you hit the ground running when you get to college.\n\n**EDIT:** Notice how everyone is saying ""you can always take CS courses at MIT by cross registering"", as if there\'s an expected deficiency by doing CS at Harvard that you\'ll need to make up for. Cross-registering is obviously great, but it\'s not as easy as people make it out to be. The 2 schools don\'t share the same schedules, and the \\~15 minute commute + time waiting for transportation can add up when you have a busy schedule, not to mention the fact that you\'ll need to go there multiple times a week for things beyond your lecture meetings, like section and office hours. Not a huge deal, but something to consider. Moreover, I personally hate the idea of having to go out of your way to supplement your courses. So all in all, I don\'t think cross registering is a perfect solution to make up for the difference between the two schools, but again, this only really matters if you want to really focus on academics.', 'score': 6, 'created_utc': 1586392733.0}, {'author': 'Visible_Professor', 'body': 'Hi!

I did well in CS 50, CS 20, and my freshman math classes, and I did okay in CS 51. Last semester I didn't do very well in Stat 110 and CS 121 (both B- :() and had an awful time, but I at least thought that was to be expected I guess since they're known to be tough.

My ass is getting kicked this semester in CS 124 to the point where I think I will be in the C range by the end of the semester unless something dramatically changes. Moreover, I am fucking miserable, struggling to get even 5 hours of sleep most nights, eating as quickly as possible, no time for friends or activities, hygiene worsening, etc. I do work with people after trying to solve things myself, but my groups are usually similarly lost and I just get bad scores on everything. I wish I could say my problems were procrastination, distractions, poor work ethic, as that would be easier to solve. Just keeping up and maintaining these bare minimums so as to not outright fail is already slowly killing me from the inside.

It's not that I don't think I'm cut out for anything tech as a whole; I did well in a software eng internship last summer and have one for this summer. But I question whether I can handle the CS program here. I have realized just how badly I suck at math and abstract things compared to the math gods in these classes. I am just struggling so bad and don't know how I can maintain this lifestyle moving forward, and I'm so scared to talk about it with anyone.

i know this isn’t true logically, but i really feel like i don’t belong here. lots of this is because of my mental health, but i suspect at least a little of it is also because of how wacky our social scene is. either way, i’m in a really bad place, don’t know where the hell i’ll find the motivation to take advantage of being here, and scared that i’ll waste it (scared that i’ve already wasted this year…), and thinking of taking a leave of absence next semester. i have a lot of lifestyle changes i need to make (just generally prioritizing self care more, being in bed *much* less, working out, reaching out to people/taking initiative, etc.)

the thing is, i think some part of my perfectionist brain won’t let me take a leave, and i genuinely do want to get to live in house life next semester, get to know my block mates better, and keep doing school. the current plan is to take this summer completely easy and hope that i’ll feel ready come move in time next year. but i don’t really know what to do.

Or even first semester... or first year. All of us come in with the intent to do everything! see everything! make the 'most', whatever that means, because you're wasting time if you don't. Then you get here, and things are harder than you thought they were, and by the end of a day, you're feeling so tired that you're not up to doing the four other things you planned to do that day. You start feeling like if you don't do everything you could possibly make yourself, then you're not doing enough, and that's a crappy feeling.\n\nIt's not like it's super easy to explain why, either. It's not just the people who weren't well equipped who feel like this, for one. I 'expected' it would be hard in these ways. But for lots of people, it will subvert your expectations in funny ways, so it almost becomes a matter of 'did I really *expect* this, since I've never felt this way before?' Not to get really philosophical about what it is to 'expect' though - it just feels different. It's a novel kind of growing pains. It's growing from great new feelings, ofc, but also growing from crappy new feelings of inadequacy, and maybe a little sadness, and then remorse over how you withdrew when sadness starting affecting you.\n\nI know it hit me hard to not be in control of how I felt all the time, as someone who has always operated on feeling in control. In short, Don't beat yourself up over things going not as expected (like I did most the first half of the year, pretty badly). Of course, it's different for everyone. I happened to have bad home dynamics going on in the background that were stressful, and have finally started coming to terms with some things about my mental health that I should be conscious of. And of course, I had so many things I loved about this year, and even with everything going on right now, it ended on a great note. I have a blocking group I love and laugh with and some amazing people in my corner (lots in other years, through my ECs) who help through dark times. \n\nJust be the best person you could be, remember what's important to you, and most importantly, be compassionate to yourself and others."", 'score': 28, 'created_utc': 1585421786.0}, {'author': 'crharvard', 'body': ""People have touched on the social and emotional bits in this thread. Lots of great comments. I guess I'll talk about academics. \n\nIn terms of broader academic tips: Harvard is a much more fulfilling and worthwhile place when you know what you want to study and what you want to pursue after college. You'll be able to tailor your experience starting from day one to maximizing your success in your concentration and connections in your department (especially if you want to do things like research). You don't need to be a super academic person for this to be important for you. Whether you want to spend time on academic research, industry career opportunities, politics/policy, art and creative pursuits, etc, once you know what you really want, you'll be able to pour time and go in depth on that thing and not waste too much time running around everywhere else. And time at Harvard is very valuable. It's 8 semesters and you're out. I'm a senior and it's crazy to me how quickly the time flew by.\n\nExploration is good! I am not at all trying to discourage that. I have done my fair share of curiosity driven exploration in creative writing here, even though I am STEM focused. But as far as primary pursuits go, I know people who have run around the whole gamut of concentrations and opportunities, and while it's more or less worked out for them in the end, their time at Harvard has been much more stressful and a little less worthwhile than it could have been. The freedom Harvard affords you with your curriculum is great, obviously, but it's sometimes a curse when you can't figure out what you exactly want to do. Other colleges with more stringent major requirements lock you in early on, which I think for some people is strangely beneficial.\n\nMaybe you are already very sure what you want to do. But if not, try to narrow your interests to a couple things prior to arriving, and explore those things while you're here. Keep an open mind, and try to identify things that you feel really excited and motivated to work on! But do so by keeping in mind that it will be best to commit to something early on. \n\nIn terms of less broad, more detailed, day to day academic tips, my advice is sorta common sense, but something I wish I had really stuck with early on (common sense isn't so common lol): \n\n1. GO TO CLASS, ALL THE TIME. Connect with your professors and faculty by going to their office hours; they WANT to spend time with you and discuss the material, and you will love your education so much more for it. Some are intimidating, but embrace the discomfort and go talk to them. You'll be surprised at how FEW of your peers actually do this. You'll thank yourself when you're searching for recommendations later on. \n2. Start your work EARLY; assignments are going to get much harder and more involved, and you'll need to spend time grappling with questions. This ain't high school work anymore. In most cases, your academic success will start to depend less on your innate intelligence and more on your diligence in starting work early and getting help in office hours.\n3. Make sure you understand things YOURSELF when you are working with others. In some really hard classes here, I see people routinely just getting trickle down answers from the few geniuses in class or generous TAs in office hours (cough cough CS124). Working together is great and all, but try to make progress yourself first before seeking assistance. \n4. The timeline for locking down summer opportunities/internships seems to get earlier and earlier every year. Start thinking about summer stuff the fall before summer (and if you're into finance and tech stuff, start the spring of the year before the summer in question -- I know, it's ridiculous).\n5. Practice time management skills prior to arriving by using a planner and/or online calendar, and find out how to do work in a style that best accommodates you (I'm a big proponent of the Pomodoro technique). It's still going to be difficult adjusting if you are the type to push yourself. But most get the hang of this throughout freshman year; you'll be fine. \n6. Try not to take more than 2 highly demanding courses each semester. Sometimes this will be hard, especially because more often than not courses are only offered during fall or spring, not both, and there may be courses you don't want to delay taking. If you plan on taking 3 (or god forbid 4) demanding courses, cut your other obligations. You will thank yourself so much for it. You will do BAD work if you are constantly sleep deprived from excess obligations (not to mention you will be miserable too).\n\nI fully admit that academics are the most important thing to me here. Not everyone cares this much about school, and that's totally fine. And some will disagree with me that early specialization is important; that's fine too, but the point stands that you will get better at something the more time you spend on it. These are the things I really wish someone had told me before I came. I turned out fine and will be going to a great grad school, but I could have avoided lots of stress by following the above."", 'score': 10, 'created_utc': 1585514912.0}, {'author': 'SmartRefuse', 'body': ""Be yourself, unconditionally.

I'm deciding between harvard and another school for econ and just had a few questions to help make my decision 

1) how intense is stress culture + competition?

2) air of elitism, is it evident, or only through convos?

3) party scene for freshman? Is it usually within suites or at frats?

4) things u wish u could change about the school

5) how long do boston winters last? And when do they begin to become bearable?

6) do suites w around 4 people have their own bathroom? Or is it connected to another adjacent suite? If so, are they of the same gender?

7) how does housing work? Do u rank it? And roommates are randomly assigned?

8) is harvard confessions a vocal minority or a general reflection of the student body's feelings?

Sadly, it sounds like all recruitment will be online. I am worried because I think it will be very hard to get a feel for the department and culture remotely... and frankly it feels like they went online because they know top students will attend no matter what (Stanford is the only other institution I was admitted to that has also gone 100% remote recruitment). Furthermore, the department discouraged personal visits! I'm bummed.

Could any SEAS grad students (or undergrads!) tell me a bit about the pros and cons of attending Harvard? I'm looking for more culture and life-related things than academic. I've spoken to some grad students... and have been **shocked by their displeasure with Harvard**! What do y'all do for fun? Are there grad student orgs and events? How hard is it to get out of Boston/Cambridge? Would I need a car? How tough is it to get by on the stipend? Would you recommend the grad student housing or off-campus? Are people super pretentious or are they down to earth and easy to get on with?

I'm an admitted student in the SEAS Bioengineering PhD and at this point I am deciding between Harvard BioE and Stanford ChemE for graduate school. I was fortunate enough to score an in-person visit to the Harvard lab I would join and was pleasantly surprised! The students in this particular lab were really enthusiastic about it and they do feel they have a healthy work-life balance (one of my biggest concerns). The research is really top-notch and I think I would enjoy the work. I will say, the softer class SEAS requirements compared to the tough ones in Stanford ChemE are appealing too... LOL.

However, I am from the Western US and life in California would be much more natural for me. I've been to Boston several times in the past year and I almost feel like I have done everything there is to do in Boston... weather doesn't help either haha. Could anyone share what grad student life is like at Harvard? Especially if you're from the west where the outdoors are plentiful! Maybe compare to Stanford if you've spent time there. My understanding is that since there are so few students in each SEAS cohort and there are no core classes there's not much community. I would plan on living in a grad dorm the first year.

I'm so lucky to have both as a choice, but I do want to pick the place that will make me happiest!

P.S. I know most of my time will be in the lab, but life happens outside of work.","[{'author': 'OmnemVeritatem', 'body': ""Hey there. I went to school in Monterey and LA and grew up in an area with a similar winter to Boston. Also, I lived in Boston for a few years. Here's my perspective.\n\nIn CA, the winters are short and not very cold. The winters in Boston can be brutal for the first couple of years, until you get used to them. Unless you live in an apartment, you'll need to shovel snow. You'll need to learn how to clear thick ice from your windshield, how to walk to black ice (or how to fall without breaking something), how to drive in very snowy/icy conditions, and you'll have to understand the particulars of very-cold-winter etiquette you may not have been introduced to in CA.\n\nIn CA, the summer/fall fire situation is really bad, and shows no sign of letting up. While you'll  be free from most snow shoveling in the winter, you will need to face the very real prospect of having to plan your life around the fires. In some cases in SF this has meant everything from changing a route, to relocating to a new apartment with the possibility of losing your stuff if the fire gets your building.\n\nThe people in CA are much friendlier. There's an old joke about racism in Boston, and while that isn't as strong in Cambridge, if you venture away from the local campus area to socialize you'll still hear some troubling comments.\n\nIn both cases you'll be moving to a college-town, unless you do what I did and live 20 - 30 minutes away. That means you'll have the company of newly minted drinkers who may be a problem on either campus. That said, both states have recreational marijuana which has (IMHO) had a positive effect on binge-drinking off/on campus.\n\nBoth areas have great amenities in food, the arts, and culture. You could argue forever about which area has a better culture scene (Boston Philharmonic vs SF Symphony, etc) but IMHO it comes down to what cultural items you like more. For example, if you want to be an extra in a movie, perhaps SF is better. But if you want to visit a theatre and watch a play, Harvard has one of the best theatre programs in the country.\n\nEconomically, Harvard wins by over 200%. According to [bestplaces.net](https://bestplaces.net) Stanford, CA has a cost of living (COL) of [463.1](https://www.bestplaces.net/cost_of_living/city/california/stanford) and Cambridge has a cost of living of [181.8](https://www.bestplaces.net/cost_of_living/city/massachusetts/cambridge). If you decide to live off campus a bit, things still sway towards Harvard by over 200% with SF county having a cost of living of [269.3](https://www.bestplaces.net/cost_of_living/city/california/san_francisco) and the Boston-Cambridge-Newton area with [135.3](https://www.bestplaces.net/cost_of_living/metro/massachusetts/boston-cambridge-newton). You should strongly  consider COL, especially in light of how much you'll be able to earn in both areas. Simply put, if you are making the same in both positions, the difference may be whether the your buck-a-meal Ramen has a side of fresh veggies or is served with spam. :-)\n\nIf you have any questions (or if anyone feels I'm off base in any area) please feel free to roasty.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Corrected COL for Stanford to San Francisco."", 'score': 12, 'created_utc': 1648480993.0}, {'author': 'tokiwon', 'body': ""G3 BIOE PhD in SEAS, more than happy to chat sometime if you're interested!"", 'score': 4, 'created_utc': 1648479452.0}, {'author': 'nicethrowaway97', 'body': ""Life outside work is very importante while in a PhD program, so I'm glad for you that you're considering it seriously. \n\nOne thing I've noticed among my friends at Stanford is that they live in San Francisco or Berkeley/Oakland and commute Stanford because the area around Stanford isn't very interesting to live in.

Some of the later responses are borderline hostile to OP, who is already thinking about dropping out. Lot of comments about how a PhD is a job and you shouldn't expect your employer to be responsible for your social life. Other snarky comments about how PhD students shouldn't be having a social life because they should be too busy studying. 

I have first-hand experience that grad student life shouldn't be crushingly isolating. At the school I did my MS (a huge Pac-12 state school), I never felt like I was excluded from anything. Not that I necessarily wanted to hang out with undergrads all day, but I had plenty of friends who were able to join primarily undergrad extracurricular groups. Sure, I get that I can't go to final clubs. PhD-age people shouldn't want to be part of that anyways. But the school newspaper, intramural sports, theater, musical performance, writing, art, and dance groups were always happy to have grad students even if they primarily served undergrads. In fact, in many cases the undergrads would even be enthusiastic to have grad students since it was interesting to learn about the experience of being a PhD student. 

I understand that a PhD is about research. But I also believe that all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. Grad students are still students and should be able to meaningfully participate in campus life. Obviously not in exactly the same way as an undergrad, but being overtly excluded from things definitely sucks.

For example,\n\n> Most of the best clubs and orgs are only for undergraduates. Crimson, the entirety of theatre, lampoon, etc..\n\nThese are all very competitive organizations (many of which have application processes) and aim to provide an intense social and professional experience to undergrads. They don't really have any reason to take graduate students.\n\n> The amazing residential life system is only for undergrads. The parties in finals clubs are only for undergrads. \n\nWhy would a grad student want to join the undergrad residential system? As far as I know, most PhD programs don't have a similar residential system as colleges that has a top-down effort to coordinate culture and social activities, and in fact most PhD students at most programs don't even live on-campus.\n\n>  Join the badminton club??\n\nAnd what's wrong with that?? Most of the club sports are pretty open to taking graduate students and even post-docs, visitors, etc. \n\nThe truth is that social life for PhDs can suck, especially if you are in a work environment (which is completely dependent on your advisor, not your school) that doesn't give you a lot of free time.

I also worked in a lab during the year/summer, and enjoyed that community with the PhD's.  In the summers, we used to have this volleyball league in that courtyard in the Bio Labs where labs played against each other.\n\nSo all this is a long-winded way of saying, you can/will have a nice social life as a PhD student, but you will have to make your own friends and explore your own hobbies.  PhD students are treated like adults and they won't hold your hands to help you find your tribe.  Undergrads are treated differently because they're basically kids.  Most of them are leaving home for the first time and the school tries to create an environment where they are in their own little bubble.  Why would you want to crash that scene?  Did you not watch Old School?  If you want to meet some undergrads, go TF a class or take some undergrad classes.

You can essentially mix and match between these but my fair warning would be Stat 110: this is exclusively a probability theory class and you won\'t get any practical coding skills of it. \n\nThe CS sequence you\'re referring to is CS109a, which is also cross-listed under the Stat department.  This sequence uses Python, with more sophisticated models (like neutral networks & machine learning that you mentioned), as well as skills like data scraping and wrangling. \n\nSince you mention ""social sciences"" to be your interest broadly, I think it\'s fair to note that the Econ department also has its fair share of courses to be data savvy, namely Ec50 (Big Data) and Ec1123/1126 (Econometrics sequence). These courses use Stata. \n\nAs someone who has done some RA work in data oriented social science projects, I would say that the skills you acquire from any one of these courses will only be solidified after you do some solid RA work.

Here's what you're going to do. This weekend, you are throwing the damn party. Go pick up at least 5 cases of cheap beer (get a few different kinds: PBR, Coors, Miller Lite). The more you can swing, the better. And pick up two handles of liquor. One of the big handles of Smirnoff, and one smaller cheap rum or something like that. Get some cheap mixers: 2L diet coke, regular coke, cranberry juice, club soda, some ginger ale.\n\nThis is something like $100 of beer, $50 of liquor, and $30 mixers.

But I worked hard. I wanted to accomplish useful things in my clubs, organizations, and studies all at once. It was sort of a delicate game, where too much pressure from one side could collapse the entire structure. But I thought I mastered the art of keeping everything under control.

And now my grades are shit. As hard as I try, it's never enough. I feel pretty shitty about myself and wish that the damage wasn't as big as it turned out to be.

Any advice?","[{'author': 'rough-hewn', 'body': 'This happened to me in my first year at Harvard (1999) and I\'m sure it happens to lots of others too. You\'re not alone in this experience. My first semester grades of freshman year were, I think, my worst of all of college. I kept them pretty steadily climbing every semester after to where I had mostly As with one or two A- grades late junior and senior years. I got my overall GPA up to a pretty respectable level and have had great opportunities since college. Things can get better for you too. Here\'s what I learned that most helped me:\n\n1. I agree with shoogenboogen\'s suggestion to let go of all but one or two extracurriculars that demand major time/effort commitments (more than, say, an hour per week). You can stay on email lists and keep up with the interesting parts of the others, but don\'t let yourself commit to stuff. You mentioned an initial goal to try all possible opportunities at Harvard. In just four years a hundred people together couldn\'t take advantage of ALL Harvard has to offer; trying will just run you ragged. Now that you\'ve had some time to explore probably just a small sampling of those opportunities, pick a few and focus on the quality of that experience for yourself and others. How do you pick which ones to keep? I suggest choosing ones where you a) really enjoy the activities, b) care about their purpose, and c) enjoy spending time with the people. For most of my friends years after graduation the most meaningful part of the extracurriculars is the friendships they developed. Which groups do you want to nourish your friendships with most? If you\'ve taken all those factors seriously and STILL have too many to choose from, then consider which will best help you develop skills for careers that interest you.\n\n2. In terms of both classes and activities taken, try to balance your workload and pace yourself. Two tough classes this semester? Try to balance it out with some less challenging ones or scale back a bit on extracurriculars for a semester. You seem to have already diagnosed this issue so not too much to add here. Just realize that if you\'ve built a system that requires delicate balance, that also requires minimal disruption from outside forces. Midterms, romantic relationships, family situations, roommate drama, illness, all kinds of other things can be big disruptive forces. If you don\'t have a bit of ""slack"" to handle those unexpected increases in stress it\'s easy to get into a downward spiral.\n\n3. Take advantage of office hours. This totally deserves its own point; I wish I had picked up on this my freshman year. Your professors and TFs want you to succeed. They can often tell who\'s struggling but can\'t really come running to all of you. The easiest way for them to help is if you come to their office hours and get some help on part of a problem set that you\'re stuck on or when you\'re struggling with a topic on a paper. Even if they seem standoffish in lectures they\'re often very personable and helpful one-on-one. Go early, well before the deadlines, before you\'re panicking, before you\'ve wasted a bunch of energy banging your head against the desk. Don\'t ask for answers or special favors but do make it clear you want to understand the material and do well in the class. They can clear roadblocks, steer you in useful directions (e.g. ""that\'s not a very interesting paper topic but have you thought about this other angle on your idea?""), better signal what they care about in grading, and prevent SO much wasted effort in your work. Two other advantages: they\'ll better understand what some students (at least you) are struggling with and may be able to adjust their lectures to be more helpful for you. You\'ll also often build good relationships with them that yield other cool opportunities. In my junior year I regularly visited the professor\'s office hours for my Thermodynamics class. I was not at the top of the class but at the end he asked me whether I\'d like to be a TF the following year, which turned out to be a really awesome opportunity.\n\n4. Join or create study groups. Again this prevents you wasting time banging your head against the desk when someone else in the group can quickly help you see something you were missing. It also reduces your feeling that you\'re alone in finding things difficult and will hopefully give you a chance to help others. Helping others with their challenges often helped me learn the material better myself. In my time Prof. Morin had a Thursday night study session in the Leverett dining hall for his Physics class. He and one of his TAs would just be on hand for any questions. Lots of other science and math Profs did the same. About half the class showed up to work on problem sets together those evenings. Whenever a bunch of us were stumped one of us went to the Prof or TA for help to unblock us. Working in those groups helped me a ton and I made some good friends at the same time.\n\n5. Get help early. Meet with your proctor or freshman dean or whatever they have these days and tell them you had a tough semester and want to know what kinds of help is available going forward before you get into a panicked or bad situation.

If you see someone's struggling, specifically invite them to your office hours to walk through a few problems together.\n* If appropriate to the course and you can manage it, think of ways to convey complex concepts that will be relatable to students' real-world intuition. I TFed a thermodynamics course, had some examples about weather that helped people mentally apply the concepts to think about daily life.\n* Be aware that if your professor is particularly unskilled instructor (there are a few out there), students will get a lot of their practical learning through you.

153,cl9ps0,hgsegrad2019,40.0,0.97,10,Harvard,"Hi all, I'm a recent grad of the Harvard Graduate School of Education TIE program and wanted to share a few thoughts here. I haven't seen many reviews  online and thought it would be good for anyone considering the program to learn about my experiences before they get involved. Of course this is my opinion and others may disagree.

The Technology, Innovation and Education program is a one year master of education degree that overall specializes in the application of technology into education. You are required to take 5 classes that fulfill TIE credits and can use the remaining credits anywhere on campus or via cross registration at other schools. The TIE credit classes at the School of Education are meant to be applicable to many different careers whether they be designing educational programs, developing new education products, starting a business in education, bringing more technology into the classroom etc. You can find most of this information online and I wanted to share some of the pros and cons of the program here.

Pros:

1. Hands down the best part of the program is the cohort of other students you work with. Our cohort was about 70 people who represented lots of different backgrounds. Off the top of my head there were successful entrepreneurs, classroom teachers, programmers, business consultants, political activists, project managers, medical professionals and more. There were not a lot of people straight out of undergrad and the majority had some kind of education related experience. All of them were very inspiring, really personable and I felt really honored to be with them.
2. Being on the Harvard campus is incredible. You are open to just about everything going on at all the schools on campus and I felt it was really easy to meet people across many different programs through extracurriculars and other activities. MIT and Tufts are open to you as well if you feel like heading to another campus! Lots of competitions, classes, talks, meet ups, sporting events and that's not even considering the other things Boston offers.
3. The faculty are great. I really liked my adviser and the professors at HGSE. Across the other campus schools people are really responsive to meet as well. So long as you're a student on campus you have access to just about anyone.

Cons

1. One year is really, really short. If you are looking to enter the education industry but are not sure of the kind of role you are looking for your job search at the end might be difficult. Two semesters really isn't long enough to develop a solid set of new skills or to try out a lot of new things in the process. If you have a very clear vision (i.e. I want to start a company or I want to transition to a project manager in education) you will absolutely have the resources available to at least learn enough to secure an entry level role somewhere perhaps with the help of an adviser or professor. The classes alone aren't a feeder into any particular role and you will need to guide all of this yourself. In my opinion, the classes weren't particularly rigorous especially when compared with the core curriculum at some of the other graduate schools.
2. The career service office is completely overloaded and are not a lot of help. I don't know of anyone that took a job from the internal job board and the coaching sessions there are limited to 20 minutes at a time. The job fairs/employment seminars were honestly a little disappointing as some of the more well known education players either weren't present, weren't hiring at the event or clearly weren't serous about recruiting there (the scholastic people didn't even bring paper to write down interested candidates information!). Also the bigger companies that visited campus such as Microsoft made clear that they would not be accepting resumes and were only there to share their experiences in education. There are career resources present at HGSE through unofficial channels like advisers, colleagues, seminars and professors but don't expect the school itself to present many opportunities.
3. Alumni support is not as good as other graduate schools on campus. You can join the Harvard alumni network however there isn't really much in terms of alumni meet ups/reunions that the other graduate schools on campus have. 
4. As everyone already know the price tag is steep. Living in Boston is much more expensive than it used to be as well.

My Recommendations

I think this program is best suited for the following kinds of people:

1. You can get some kind of scholarship and get a leg up in classroom teaching opportunities. I personally don't think that the price of the program justifies the amount of ""leg up"" you get in teaching.
2. You are serious about starting a business in education and want to make use of all the entrepreneurship resources there.
3. Your company/school/organization will pay for this somehow or you will work in your original employer with some sort of bonus at the end of the program. 9 months is possible for some employers to work with and you can do the program part time over 2 years however I don't think there are many spots available for this.
4. You have a very defined transition into another career. Your first semester will be spent figuring out life at Harvard and your second semester will be all about finding a job. There is not a lot of time to test things out and see what you like. This is quite similar to other students I spoke to at MIT and the Kennedy school doing one year programs as you really don't have enough time to experience things like at 4 years of undergrad. Decide what you want to do in October at the latest and get as many skills and contacts in that industry/company as possible.
5. You already have a core skill i.e. programming, data analysis, financial modeling, graphic design etc. and want to transition into education. You can gain credibility in education within two semesters but don't have the time to master a ""hard skill."" The technology classes there coupled with a lot of outside resources can help but it will be a very busy year for you and will sacrifice a lot of the ""Harvard experience"" to do this. The motto on campus is that your fifth class every semester is ""Harvard"" due to the amount of activity on campus throughout the year.
6. The students who found work afterwards were typically doing roles such as curriculum designer, learning designer, community partnerships manager, non profit coordinators, education researchers and teachers. A few people went back to their original jobs in some form and a quite a few others are still looking for work a few months after graduation. 

Ultimately the consensus I've seen from alumni and colleagues is that it is a really enjoyable experience but may not be the most effective use of time and money unless you fit the above categories. Like many other roles in this day and age if you are really passionate about entering a certain profession there are many other ways of doing it rather than getting another degree.

Prison reformer and Harvard alumnus [Thomas Mott Osborne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Mott_Osborne) — Harvard University 1884, Harvard Law School 1887 — voluntarily entered Auburn Prison to live as a prisoner for one week in 1913. In his 1914 book ***Within Prison Walls*** that recounts the entire episode, he details going through the admission process of the prison where [he states the following](https://archive.org/details/cu31924100610371/page/n61/mode/2up):

""Then a series of measurements from top to toe is taken, and every possible means of identification noted and registered: color of hair and eyes; shape of head; characteristics of eyes, nose, mouth; the scar received at football thirty-four years ago, which I supposed was successfully concealed by my right eyebrow; the minute check on the left ear from a forgotten frostbite; the almost imperceptible bit of smooth skin on the back of my right hand, where a small lump was once removed by electricity; no blemish or defect is over-looked—until I begin to feel like a sort of monstrosity.  
""I derive some satisfaction, however, from the fact that my business-like inquisitor is quite at a loss to account for **six peculiar scars upon my upper left arm, familiar to Harvard men of my generation**. It is some satisfaction to know that my Alma Mater has not sent many of her sons to take a post-graduate course in this institution.""

After much research I have yet to discover *any* information about what those ""six peculiar scars"" are, exactly. Why six? Why the upper left arm? Were they ever administered on the right arm? Were these scars only familiar to Harvard men of his generation, meaning the 1880s, or was/is this a continuing tradition? Was this a kind of initiation? Or something earned?

The president at the time, Eliot, basically said it's between them nothing he can do -- and even if they clamped down on the drinking they drink more in town anyways.\n\nDickeys came out of DKE, a fraternity out of Yale with different societies for freshman vs sophmores vs seniors.

When DKE came to Harvard it kind of morphed into it's own thing but the behavior stayed the same even if the names of the clubs changed. e.g., sophmores would be invited into Institute of 1770, and the more socially-affluent would then be invited into Dickeys, and the Final Clubs like Porcelain and Fox and others then selected members from them."", 'score': 16, 'created_utc': 1681538509.0}, {'author': 'reader106', 'body': ""It sounds like secret society stuff...  people who know probably can't say."", 'score': 1, 'created_utc': 1681531054.0}, {'author': 'Temporary_Zone268', 'body': 'This is a reference to the Dickey Club.

While I'm at it, I wanted to address a new rule for posting in the subreddit. I have had a few users mention to me that we should experiment with a new rule regarding Harvard Extension School posts. A significant percentage of posts about HES tend to be ""ontological""; they are about name HES name recognition, comparative prestige, ""is it real Harvard"", admissions rigor, etc. This is a very tired topic and over-debated (I'm sure you can all agree). I want to be clear that the moderators of this subreddit do not endorse any particular view on these posts, but do seek to curate discussion that is productive instead of adversarial and over-done. To that end:

**The (tentative) new rule (call it Rule 1a) is any HES post must not be ontological as described above**. To be very clear about what this means, here are some examples of HES posts that would and would not be removed under rule 1a.

Removed | Not Removed
---|---
[Exhibit A](https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/bjbaqy/about_to_be_a_graduate_from_hes_with_extension/) | [Exhibit 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/admddj/hes_what_time_are_grades_posted/) 
[Exhibit B](https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/5ji6qb/can_i_tell_my_friends_i_go_to_harvard_if_its_hes/) | [Exhibit 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/aixskc/hes_alb_acronym_history/)
[Exhibit C](https://reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/4i9dj4/harvard_extension_schoolbad_rep/&ved=2ahUKEwi60_eju97qAhVJ5awKHUwKA1MQFjACegQIBxAB&usg=AOvVaw1jG4m3obD13F7ucQU3j9FV) | [Exhibit 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/92d6t7/my_harvard_email_not_deleted_after_my_class_at/)

I hope the distinction is clear from these examples. If not, feel free to comment below and I'll try to explain further. 

---

The types of posts for Rule 1a. are difficult to configure into the automoderator because of the nuanced and complicated nature of how they can be worded. Key words are not good enough. **So, in full transparency, I have added an automoderator rule that requires any HES post (literally containing those key words) to be approved by a moderator before they make it to the subreddit.** This is definitely not ideal, and I don't mean it to be an affront to HES posts, but it's the only way I could figure out to enforce this rule. Rest assured that I will approve your HES posts nearly as soon as they are submitted, as I enabled push notifications for moderator approvals on my phone. We of course want to keep this subreddit open for HES student discussion, news, memes, events, etc. 

As with all other rules, if a moderator decides that the post violates Rule 1a, then a flair will be added to the post indicating as such and it will be removed.

For the past few years, I've been removing posts that are news articles about Harvard if they are not from The Crimson or if there isn't a corresponding story in The Crimson about it. The reason for this is that otherwise we would get too many news articles from outlets that like to include ""Harvard"" in their article title, and karma farmers who cross post those sorts of things.

The other reason I do this is because generally The Crimson is a pretty good standard for news about Harvard -- if it is truly Harvard-related and important, the Crimson will report on it; if not, then it won't. So that's why we have this unwritten rule in place. 

It was brought to my attention that this should probably be clarified in our rules on the sidebar. So this post just a notice to everyone that I am adding that as a rule, unless enough people are against it and we need to rethink it.

176,xgp4zm,firstyearburner,28.0,0.98,9,Harvard,"I will preface this post by saying that I have had a great first few weeks here, but now that the novelty of starting a new life at college has begun to wear off I've noticed that I have been slightly struggling socially.

&#x200B;

As a first-year who just started here, I am finding the social scene a little difficult to navigate. I knew no one coming here, so this was a complete reset of my social life and finding a close group of friends is proving to be quite the challenge for me. There are plenty of people who I would consider myself friends with, but it is very surface level and does not go further than activities like eating in Annenberg. I have not done anything on the weekends with a group of people and have found myself spending my Friday nights alone in my dorm.

&#x200B;

Since I've got here, I've mostly been hoping that extracurriculars would help provide a place for bonding and making close friends, but I have been dropped from pretty much every comp process that I have done. There are a few completion based comps that I feel like I can do, but most of those are just lectures where it is difficult to make good friends. I have joined some cultural clubs, but those have not picked up yet.

&#x200B;

I do have a very solid pset group for classes, but it feels like nothing exists outside of grinding our next assignment in whichever library we choose to go to. It seems like a lot of them already have their established friend groups as well, as after we finish working for they night they call their friends and meet up to relax a bit. I am friendly with them, but it is clear that I cannot break into that group of people yet.

&#x200B;

From my perspective, I think the issue is that I am not putting enough effort on my end to schedule stuff with people. Up to this point, I have basically been hoping to be invited to events and putting zero effort in myself which is a big issue. But it feels a little strange to ask to do something with people that I only know either very lightly, or only in the context of doing schoolwork.

&#x200B;

As I mentioned above, I have had a great time here and I know that finding the right group of people is something that will just take time. After all, I have only been on campus for just a couple of weeks and that is not a long time to have made very close relationships with anyone. I just feel a little alone right now, which is probably typical for first-years in the first few weeks of school.

It’s extremely likely that the people you interact with now are also having a hard time or have to go outside their comfort zone to forge friendships, so it’s more likely than not that they’d love to spend more time socializing with you but just weren’t sure if you were interested in spending time with them. I’d say just find something you and a few others would enjoy and go for it! If they say no or things get awkward, either they’re busy or maybe they’re not the people you’ll eventually end up being really close friends with.

I'm a first year PhD and I've been really sad lately at how little there is to get involved in as a graduate student. Most of the resources and opportunities that make Harvard a special place are reserved for undergraduates.

Most of the best clubs and orgs are only for undergraduates. Crimson, the entirety of theatre, lampoon, etc..

The amazing residential life system is only for undergrads. The parties in finals clubs are only for undergrads. What are grad students even supposed to do outside of research? Join the badminton club?? 

In my undergrad I did a lot of writing and theatre as an outlet and now I'm basically banned from doing either in any of the most active organizations.

Going to a bar and drinking with friends is sooo boring.. I wanna actually do shit. The mountaineering club has been really nice and let me join. Idk it's just hard to make friends outside your lab group and no one really cares. There are no school wide events for graduate students. No culture of going to the Harvard-Yale game. 

Some people tell me that this is what graduate school is like everywhere. That most of the institutions are primarily focused on making the undergraduate life as best as it can be. Graduate school is like a job they say, you're supposed to just sit around in lab all day. I didn't know this.. I thought I go to a research institution. To a school where they'd care about making sure we had lives outside of research and had outlets to keep our mental health straight.

I was so happy thinking about having a “family” on campus. I have plenty of friends at Harvard, but I really wanted a solid friend group who I could hang out with all the time, go out to eat with, and get super close to. Not just sporadically see or study with.

I got rejected from every single RSO I did recruitment for. I don’t know why. I thought we had great conversations, I thought I vibed with the people. I thought I was going to have friends. This hurts so much worse because it’s not a rejection based on academics or skills. The criteria for joining an RSO is that you’re the type of person they want to be friends with.
It’s a rejection of me as a person. The members for multiple organizations each got together, multiple times, and sat down and agreed I’m not someone they’d ever want to spend time with or be around. 

I don’t know what’s wrong with me that none of them at all would have me as a friend. Wondering what I did wrong. Was I not fun enough, not social enough, not friendly enough? I thought our conversations were great.

200,e9z4g6,depressedatharvard,36.0,0.91,27,Harvard,"Hey guys, 

So, idk if this is the right spot for this, but here goes:

This is my first semester (I’m a first-year) and it’s been the most miserable few months of my life. Every day I’ve been here I’ve just been sad. I know I’m clinically depressed and all that stuff, but I’ve never been this bad to the point where–now that I’ve got to take finals–I just want to curl up and die somewhere. 


Socially, I had a group for a little bit but there was a bit of a falling out–it wasn’t really anyone’s fault, but it was enough for me to distance myself and so I lost any sense of social belonging earlier in the semester. In terms of clubs, it’s just been a steady stream of rejections. And in terms of academics, I push myself so damn hard and I still get really shitty grades and I’m probably going to just end up with all Cs and maybe a B if I’m lucky. I just feel really inadequate all the time and everyone is always talking about grade inflation and complains about their A- or whatever, meanwhile I’m literally at the bottom of all my classes and I kind of just want to die because of it. I did go to a kind of shitty public school where I didn’t have to try very hard in general, but I’ve always pushed myself and no matter how hard I try I can’t seem to fix anything in any aspect of my life and it’s been so incredibly frustrating. My finals have all been ass, even though I’ve given up what little time I made for myself to throw myself 100% into preparing for them. 

I tried to convince myself that, at the very least I could do something fun or cool over the summer because Harvard’s name–no matter how much I hate this place and no matter how miserable I’ve been–is powerful enough to open doors. I realize now how misguided that was, because I’m on-track to go home and be depressed for 3 months over summer break and nothing else. Maybe pick up an odd job or two but nothing relevant to my goals. 

I don’t know who to go to for support. CAMHS gave me the option of antidepressants or weird fucking support groups, that I know wouldn’t help me. My parents think that Harvard is the best place on earth and that I’m silly to be so sad while I’m here. I don’t have friends really. I’m just so at my wit’s end. I know it’s only one semester and I’m probably just a whiny idiot for complaining this much, but I really can’t see any way out of this mess. I don’t know if I should consider transferring, and even if I did, I don’t know what school would take my shitty GPA and useless/non-existent extracurriculars. A part of me thought that maybe this was something to discuss with PAFs or my advisor, but it seems like PAFs are just there to cart in food for study breaks and advisors to lift the hold on your account. 

And, even if I do stay at this school, I don’t see how things would be different next semester or the one after that or the one after that. It’s clear that I’m not academically capable enough for this school and there doesn’t seem to be a way for me to fix that. I’m just over everything kind of at this point. Life, Harvard,  everything else. 

I’m on mobile and I have fat fucking fingers so I apologize for any grammatical errors. 

I’d appreciate any advice or something. I don’t know. I don’t even know why I’m posting this, I just feel like I need to scream myself hoarse but this the next best thing, I guess.","[{'author': 'RichieCunningham', 'body': 'Hey man, for what it’s worth, I found the first semester easily the most difficult.

I developed really bad social anxiety (which I had before, but it got worse not knowing people) and that made me feel even more isolated.

Go after unofficial summer positions and less prestigious locations/organizations. Even with the Harvard name, it’s really really difficult to get internships when you have to apply as a freshman. Chances are, if it’s a company/organization you’ve heard of and has an online application, they’re getting 100+ applications mostly from uperclassmen. Either find organizations/startups that most people haven’t heard of, or find internships that don’t have applications by emailing people at organizations you like that don’t have postings and asking to intern with them. That way you won’t be competing against 100 seniors. \n\n3.) Join campus clubs that have multiple years of students. First year programs and friend groups are great and all, but all-frosh friend groups are fragile af and they won’t be able to help you with academic advice or navigating Harvard systems. Having even a few uperclassmen friends will replace what those advisors are supposedly for and will lend some stability to your social circles. \n\nGood luck!

Also make sure you’re taking classes that interest you and that you WANT to put in the work for.

And take advantage of office hours, with TAs as well as profs - it’s what they’re there for and it super helps!! - and look to form study groups if your entryway-mates or other people you know are in the same class. \n\nMental health wise - if UHS isn’t helping, what about exploring some of the peer counseling options on campus?  I would also talk to your RA (or whatever they call the person who lives in your entryway, it’s been 10 yrs and I’ve forgotten) and your academic advisor - they could be good sources of help.

All the comments are highly negative toward H for various reasons - too expensive, poor job outlook, heathens, etc. Many are validating the parents' beliefs that Harvard is just an overpriced version of the local community college.
  
There are a bunch of misinformed comments saying that the quality of education/learning is the same everywhere (which I disagree with coming from my non-H undergrad) and that Harvard will just lead to graduating with a lot of debt and no good jobs (there is a mom on this thread saying they know lots of Harvard grads who work at Starbucks with 6 figures of debt...)

Recently there was a drugging incident at our university that inspired a huge campus protest that attracted local news. Students have been trying to force the Hopkins administration to implement a university-wide program that will prevent sexual violence at primarily Greek-held events— perhaps by having sober monitors drug test drinks on students’ behalf, or by having drinks distributed by a third party. But we aren't certain on any details yet, so we're open to ideas.

There’s been quite a bit of pushback from the university and so I’m really interested in connecting with your university’s sexual violence prevention club/team, as well as determining what y’all do to monitor or prevent druggings and alcohol-adjacent sexual violence.

I didn't really care about college environment or campus life because I believed most of it was pretty bs. I was going to be in a city and in the best college in the world. I could make my own life great at Harvard. I would make a ton of friends, go out, have fun, typical college life.

Fast forward two years later and I can't help but laugh at myself. These past two years at Harvard have been so awful. 3.7 GPA which is ok but not great enough right now, terrible dorm situation freshman year where there was literally no community b/c I lived in Wigg and my suitemates and I just did not vibe, failed a comp (twice) that consumed my life and as a result ruined my grades and opportunities to socialize or meet people or join more inclusive clubs freshman year, a toxic blocking group that just fell apart, and one big hunk of depression and an ocean of suicide thoughts. 

I see everyone I know at Yale loving college and wanting to go back to school. On the other hand, all of my friends at Harvard say the same thing ""I should have gone to Yale. They're happy."" ""I hate Harvard."" We all chose Harvard because of the clout, and in the end got handed literally no dorm or ""house"" community, an incredibly exclusive and toxic social culture, and ridiculous semester-long comp processes just to join a fucking club. It's like Harvard has to put barriers for everything and make everything so hard to get. Seeing other students at Yale, Princeton, Stanford be way happier and be at just as good of a school is really disappointing. A big part of me regrets choosing Harvard and wish I had applied to other schools and really researched their campus life instead of just jumping the gun as soon as I got into Harvard early action.

They are my primary noise-canceling earbuds/headphones because they perform almost as well as the BOSE below, but are much smaller and their charge lasts forever. You'll need to ensure you get a good fit with the ears though, and some folks won't like the feel of them. I've worn them for about 100 hours, and have never been left with dead batteries. Like most of the Sony products, they have transient, noise-canceling, and also normal modes. The problem is, the transient effect will switch to full-on noise-canceling causing a few seconds delay where you can't hear anything. If you are in an environment where you may need to hear someone randomly talking to you, this is a problem. However, if you use them in transient-mode while on the phone the folks listening to you won't notice. These are also the only USB-C rechargeable headphones on the list, which means they take less time to recharge and is probably why I've never had them go dead.\n\n2 - BOSE Quiet Comfort 35 II Wireless Bluetooth - These are over-the-ear headphones and dominated the noise-canceling arena for years. Because they are over the ear, they do a great job of canceling more noise than the in-ear types. The reason I don't like them as much as the sony WH-1000XM3's is I tend to sweat in my ears when wearing the BOSE.\n\n3 - Jabra Elite Active 65t Earbuds - Normally, I would rate these well, but frankly, the fall out of my ears all the time. Also, the software to control them is crap. That said, they are my only waterproof pair, so you can't fault that. Also, for phone calls, I've found they fade in and out, and I usually need to switch to wired. So, fall out of the ear on airplanes and don't do well on calls... so next-to-last place.\n\nWife's Favorite: Sony WI-1000X My wife works in a noisy office environment that needs good noise-canceling. However, she also hates the ear-bud thing because she's concerned about losing them. I got her these and they are her daily driver.  She has the same transient-noise-canceling switch issue noted for the earbuds in #1 above.\n\nTLDR: Sony makes great products, and I recommend either the WF-1000XM3 (if you want earbuds) or the Sony WI-1000X (if you want something more secure). I recommend BOSE quiet comfort if you want over-the-ear headphones. If you exercise and want an earbud with noise-canceling that is waterproof, the Jabra Elite is a great choice as long as you make sure you get a good fit in your ear.\n\nEdit: Changed the nomenclature of the headphones to WF-1000XM3.

5. Econ 50:

Great intro class that requires basically no knowledge of econ, or math, or coding, or much of anything useful, and since you are a humanities kid thats probably right up your alley. 

4. Math 21b 

Linear algebra, really? It doesn't get much easier than this. y = mx +b, come on, that's baby shit. This is just like learning what lines are, the only tricky part is now they call them vectors––big whoop. 

3. Applied Math 22a

coming in at just 8 hours of work per week according to the Q guide this is like linear algebra but, like, applied, sounds easy to me. The prof uses the word ""gentle"" in the course description, it doesn't get much easier than that. 

2. Math 23a

So this one is like the baby linear algebra mentioned earlier but now there is some ""real analysis"" tacked on. Oh boy, I go day to day looking at real things, now you want me to analyze them? Cake walk!

1.Math 55a 

""Studies in algebra and group theory""?  Your biggest challenge in this course will be trying to remember the basic algebra you learned in like 6th grade. The group theory portion? The perfect prep for blocking groups. 

Some people claim this is the hardest math class in the country, but thats mostly hype so people dont figure out how easy this class is.

I first want to say that declaring econ is not a choice, I didn't wake up one day and decide ""I want to pick the most popular concentration that offers some of the most lucrative job opportunities after graduation"",  I woke up one morning clutching a copy of Wealth of Nations and blabbering to my roommate about reverse causality. 

To some of you it may seem like I am equating the struggle of being an ec concentrator with that of LGBTQ Americans, and you would be right, that's exactly what I am doing (because this is satire). Some would say that the backlash ec conentators face is actually more nefarious than regular-ol homophobia; I think much of the hatred of econ is based in the view that it is twinged with pre-professionalism and that students in the field  have merely forgone Harvard's fantastic academic opportunities to study something that will get them a job at Goldman. Regardless of whether or not that is true, the notion that Harvard students should not focus on finding a job and making money post grad has undertones of a quiet privilege, deaf to students from economically insecure backgrounds who do not feel they have the luxury of entering the job market without classically marketable job skills, and inconsiderate of other colleges and universities that serve merely as engines of economic mobility and not academic playgrounds.

These past few weeks have been a powerful reminder of just how connected we are to one another—and how our choices today determine our options tomorrow.\n\n \n\nFortunately, a group of extremely dedicated people has been working literally around the clock to respond to the challenges posed by COVID-19. Our teams are considering every contingency as they undertake their important work, and I write today to update you on major near-term changes that will limit exposure to the disease among members of our community:\n\n \n\nWe will begin transitioning to virtual instruction for graduate and undergraduate classes. Our goal is to have this transition complete by Monday, March 23, which is the first day of scheduled classes following Spring Recess.\n \n\nStudents are asked not to return to campus after Spring Recess and to meet academic requirements remotely until further notice. Students who need to remain on campus will also receive instruction remotely and must prepare for severely limited on-campus activities and interactions. All graduate students will transition to remote work wherever possible. Schools will communicate more specific guidance and information, and we encourage everyone to review prior guidance about both international and domestic travel.\n \n\nWe are transitioning over the course of the next few days to non-essential gatherings of no more than 25 people. Please note this is a change from prior guidance.\n \n\nThe decision to move to virtual instruction was not made lightly. The goal of these changes is to minimize the need to gather in large groups and spend prolonged time in close proximity with each other in spaces such as classrooms, dining halls, and residential buildings. Our actions are consistent with the recommendations of leading health officials on how to limit the spread of COVID-19 and are also consistent with similar decisions made by a number of our peer institutions. The campus will remain open, and operations will continue with appropriate measures to protect the health of the community.\n\n \n\nFor regular updates and additional information, please visit this dedicated webpage. Provost Alan Garber, Executive Vice President Katie Lapp, and HUHS Executive Director Giang Nguyen will continue to send you updates by email as needed. You will also continue to receive School- or Unit-specific information from local leadership. If you are a student or faculty member and have specific questions or concerns, I encourage you to be in touch with the contacts identified by your dean. If you are an employee, I encourage you to be in touch with your manager.\n\n \n\nDespite our best efforts to bring the University’s resources to bear on this virus, we are still faced with uncertainty—and the considerable unease brought on by uncertainty. It will take time for researchers, a good many of them who are our colleagues, to understand enough about this disease to mount a reliable defense against it. Now more than ever, we must do our utmost to protect those among us who are most vulnerable, whether physically or emotionally, and to treat one another with generosity and respect. Please remember that Harvard Counseling and Mental Health Services and the Harvard Employee Assistance Program are available to help you manage anxiety and stress. Your mental health is just as important as your physical health.\n\n \n\nTo our students, I know it will be difficult to leave your friends and your classrooms. We are doing this not just to protect you but also to protect other members of our community who may be more vulnerable to this disease than you are.\n\n \n\nTo our faculty, I recognize that we are asking you midway through the semester to completely rethink how you teach. We do this because we know that you want to avoid putting your students at risk.\n\n \n\nTo our staff, I understand that we are expecting you to go above and beyond in your efforts to support our important mission of teaching and scholarship. We do this because we know we can rely on your creativity, flexibility, and judgment through these challenging times.\n\n \n\nI am proud to be a member of a community where people put the greater good above their own self-interest. Thank you for your patience and your resilience as we all learn to temper increased distance with deeper care for one another.\n\n \n\nWith appreciation,\n\nLarry\n\n \n\n____________________\n\nLawrence S.

As I am walking from to Sever I hear a guy behind me say ""help a veteran get something to eat."" I turn around and I see a middle aged black gentleman in a wheelchair. 

I pull the Cliff bar out of my pocket and I asked him, ""Hey man I just bought this, do you want it?"" 

He looks at the bar and asks, ""Is it gluten free?"" 

I start looking at the back of the package and say ""I dunno man, I don't think so."" 

He, casually replies, ""Don't worry about it then."" 

I can't stop thinking about this interaction, so much about it was so weird.

I fully acknowledge that this man is a human being and has the absolute right to turn down my food if he doesn't want it.

247,txfhfa,aromatic_mulberry,31.0,0.91,6,Harvard,"Hiee people!

not sure where to start but would like to hear y'all's \*\*opinions\*\* or experiences

I'm currently a sophomore and I have this massive impostor syndrome, I'm always feeling bad about myself for not having friends and a social life

like if I go to a party or sth, I'll always be at the corner on my phone, not that i'have not tried to socialize

also I feel like a stranger whichever social club I go to, as a queer person, I never feel welcomed at any queer spaces, people treat me like I'm not gay enough (which I think has to do with my absolute lack of knowledge of pop culture), it's the same with any other affinity groups

however hard I try to join a conversation or something, I always get left out eventually

once a person noticed that I was awkwardly sitting at a corner at a social event, so she accompanied me and helped me talk to people introducing me to them, but they none of them even cared about talking to me, like I told them my name, basic Harvard intro shit and then they acted like I am completely invisible

also I've seen people say like you'll find your niche, I found joy in arts, or theatre or music or blah blah, but I have zero artistic skills and I feel like there's no such group that I can be a part of

sometimes, when I am mindlessly folding my laundry or walking alone across the yard, I question how I even got in

I no longer enjoy things that I enjoyed in high school like model un, debates, mostly because they're too competitive for my level here and the people are too pretentious?

I have barely found a club/activity that promotes growth and learning, everything is a competitive process, like com'on I don't wanna be competing for a fun activity to do when I already have psets, readings and stuff to do

not making the rant any longer,,,

how do I genuinely make friends and explore my interest at this place because I feel like all of my high school interests have become obsolete 

how do I become less weird and less alone

also I'm writing this at 2 am instead of submitting my discussion post due 6 hours ago, I honestly don't know what I am doing with my life here...","[{'author': 'Apsalar_ara', 'body': 'Thank you for sharing your experience, and I\'m sorry it isn\'t going so well. I\'m sure that you\'ve heard a million times that many students go through a sad state where they feel alone, but it probably doesn\'t seem real. When you are truly alone and see these supposedly lonely students with their friends, it doesn\'t seem like they actually understand what you are going through. I understand, I\'ve experienced it before. The only friend, hell the only acquaintance, I had was during my first two years was a phd student. I always ate alone and walked alone. I used to have a long distance relationship for a while and that helped,  I never got the ""harvard experience"" I heard so much about it. Any club I joined at first seemed nice but then everyone but me seemed to grow close. I eventually gave up and didn\'t do any extracurriculars. Fast forward to today and I still have no friends or acquaintances. I still take my meals alone in my room. I never became less weird and less alone. Fortunately I am able to graduate a year early, but my experience has been rough.\n\nHonestly, I strongly believe that Harvard is more of a social school than an academic school. The academics are great, but Harvard is defined by the relationships between students. A lot of groups seems to form instantly and if you aren\'t very proactive, you will get left out. If you want friends, you need to spend a lot of effort and you have to be very social. Either that or you have to get extremely lucky to find someone who immediate accepts you. That is an unfortunately truth. I\'m not really sure the best way to approach making friends. Hell if you figure it out please let me know. There are some clubs that don\'t have any comps, but I haven\'t had much luck with them.\n\nHonestly, you shouldn\'t worry too much about your grades. Most jobs won\'t even care about what classes you took or what your grades were. If you care about your GPA, you can easily do the bare minimum and find the easiest courses. I chose harder courses that were interesting, but honestly I was so bummed about my social life that I had no motivation to do my schoolwork. It sucks because now I\'m not super excited about my concentration and future work. And honestly, I have no idea how to find my passion again. I hope that you have better luck than I have had. It might be a good idea for next semester to take some courses you can breeze through.\n\nAlso, don\'t worry too much about imposter\'s syndrome. Yes, there are some geniuses here, but the majority of students here are pretty average. I can assure you that even if they seem smart, a lot of times they are just spouting bs or surface level knowledge confidently. I know I\'ve done the same. But just like there are geniuses here, there are also really dumb people here as well. They might not be readily apparent, but they exist. As you advance in your studies, these people slowly disappear, so just know that even if you don\'t see them in your course doesn\'t mean they don\'t exist. I don\'t know if that is comforting or not, but I think it does help to consider that the students here are on a huge spectrum of intelligence, if you can even define such a spectrum.\n\nOne thing that has helped me is to think about what life would satisfy me and what life would make my happy. Yes, it would be great to be happy, but going from sad to happy is unreasonable. So it helps to figure out what life you would be satisfied with, and work towards that first. Then only when you are satisfied can you work to be happy. For me, being satisfied is to have a decent job, a cat, and the internet. Happiness entails either a solid friendship outside of the work environment and a romantic relationship. Setting a goal that is more obtainable that you would be satisfied with should help a bit with the feeling of despair.\n\nAlso, there are many resources to help with depression and stuff, but I\'ve never felt comfortable using them. The help either comes from other students who don\'t seem like they actually understand you, or from adults who are just essentially older students who also won\'t understand you. Maybe you can relate. However, maybe they may help you. That\'s for you to decide.\n\nI\'m not sure how coherent this is, and I\'ve probably left a lot out. Feel free to PM me with anything questions or if you need anything.

But once one gets over that….My favorite thing is how the College really feels like a small liberal arts school attached to an amazing R1. Almost every person I’ve met working at the College with students really loves students and their work. It’s an amazing wonderful place and Cambridge is the best of both a city and a suburb—lots of trees everywhere, so many interesting, diverse people, an amazing food scene….\n\nCongrats on your acceptance and I hope that you come to love Harvard College and Cambridge as much as I do!', 'score': 29, 'created_utc': 1672269655.0}, {'author': 'Piano-Feet', 'body': 'I can firmly say it’s the people.\n\nThere are some great classes for sure, but having attended a lesser known school with a much smaller endowment for undergrad, I can attest to the fact that you can get that pretty much anywhere. Not that Harvard is easy, but coming here dispels the mystical nature of the place to an extent. That professor whose research you idolized is just a human just like everyone else. They are brilliant, but there comes a point where even an amazing class is just a class.\n\nThe opportunities are also plentiful. As long as you put yourself out there, you will find some way to either find or create a hands-on learning experience to apply the skills you’re learning during your studies. Many schools have limited resources to provide such opportunities, and those limitations also can come in the form of available support even if you have the initiative to create an opportunity for yourself. Even so, you still have to work to take advantage of those opportunities no matter where you go. It’s just that your hard work probably goes farther at Harvard.\n\nMost of all though, Harvard has been a great experience because a place like this attracts many incredibly bright people (and I’d be lying if I said their brilliant marketing didn’t have anything to do with it). Those people and the connections you will make with them are what make this place what it is. There is nothing quite like being able to have a deep conversation over a mutual passion. Throughout my undergrad and even as a working professional, those kinds of connections were harder to come by, but they have been much more common at Harvard. Furthermore, usually the best I could hope for was someone to talk ideas with. At Harvard, we talk about plans instead.\n\nThat being said, my experience as a graduate student may differ from yours as an undergrad. I hear that undergrads at Harvard often struggle with a culture of competition, and the first few years of college will also a major adjustment no matter what school you go to. High school was probably a completely different ball game and I won’t sugar coat things: many people REALLY struggle (and it’s okay to struggle!) in one way or another. It might not happen for you right away, but there will come a point where you’ll stop feeling threatened by the impressiveness of your fellow classmates and instead feel inspired by it. Give it time and self reflection, and eventually you will be able to bask in that sense of wonder and appreciate each other to form connections instead of rivalries.

Basically, I feel like I completely screwed up my Harvard experience. I don't love my blocking group and never found another core group of friends. I really regret the concentration I chose (think STEM, SEAS) and wish I had studied something relatively ""easier,"" a major that I could've grasped better. I've struggled so much that I couldn't tell you anything I actually learned at this point; I went through the motions and just tried my best on the psets by working with other people, and almost never did well on tests. I absolutely hate myself for getting the GPA I did; if I do very well this semester, I'll graduate with a 3.3, which by Harvard standards is pretty shitty (correct me if I'm wrong). It's frustrating because whenever I try to open up to people (mainly my blocking group, I guess), they dismiss me for various reasons. My GPA is a very real concern since I may consider an MBA, so I feel like I really fucked up. I just feel very dumb and incompetent here and it seems that everyone else at this point has it all together.

There's so much to be grateful for, which also makes it conflicting. I'm thankful for Harvard financial aid, esp. as a low-income student. I went through OCI and somehow got a job – I definitely don't think I'd be in the position I'm in without Harvard.

Founded in Harvard earlier this year, [Students vs Pandemics](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/3/20/harvard-student-pandemic-group/) is an interdisciplinary group of grad and undergrad students building community and empowering students to make a positive impact on health and overall wellness during times of crisis. Our three primary goals are to improve transparency and communication, build community, and identify needs and innovate solutions. We share health education material, resources for students, and opportunities to serve our greater community through our[ resources spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dTerz_XiSYghoEMn01biDnqqBM_pQIa3S8o-BhEKy-s/edit#gid=531738015) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/studentsvspandemics/), write policy memos for state legislators, organize virtual COVID hackathons, address the digital disparity, and launch other initiatives. SvP gained over 100 volunteer members within a week of its launch and is now there are over 370 members from different chapters all over the country (more chapters oversea are being built!)

We are constantly looking for experts in all fields. As we know, we are in a huge public health crisis from COVID-19 and systemic racism; and interdisciplinary efforts are needed more than ever. We are also listening to community needs to tailor our efforts to better help the community (so if you have any feedback or concerns about a certain topic during this crisis, don't hesitate to contact us).

If you are interested in our organization (e.g. building a chapter, joining our organization) or have any questions, feedback, or concerns, please visit our [Website](http://studentsvspandemics.com/), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/studentsvspandemics/), [Facebook](http://facebook.com/studentsvspandemics) and/or shoot us a PM!

It won't be long into the semester where it'll be too complicated to bring classes back to in person because people will have to make housing arrangements. \n\nThat said, I am tentatively thinking we won't be online. I've heard over and over from professors this past semester that there's a strong inclination against returning to online unless absolutely necessary. It's one thing for J-term since it's very short and less important. J-Term also makes sense because we're about to hit the biggest wave of Omicron with the holidays. I'm hoping the US will mirror South Africa a bit where the caseload will be insane but for a relatively short period of time, in which case the peak will probably be past us by the time we hit the spring semester.\n\nAlso, the university has repeatedly said that there is no evidence that there is any in-class transmission as long as people wear masks, and that case increases typically come from large social gatherings outside of school. \n\nBest Case Scenario: We're back for spring semester and it looks exactly like fall semester.\n\nWorst Case Scenario: Harvard wants to be performative and probably announces we'll be fully online by the end of the first week of J-Term.\n\nLikely Case Scenario in my opinion: We stay in person but case numbers continue to rise.

Personally, my preferences would be determined by whether Omicron is ~as serious as past variants in terms of hospitalizations; if so, I think an in-person semester would be irresponsible.

Maybe they’ll be very serious on the “we can’t guarantee housing if you gap” front in the coming years, but based on the spring semester and how hard it was to find off-campus housing in Cambridge then, I truly don’t think there’s capacity enough in Cambridge for people to take gaps en masse. I was on campus in the spring, and I think it will be just like the spring in the beginning with the exception of potentially in person classes; no off-campus guests, no overnight guests, going back to the red orange yellow lime green stages of social rules, grab and go meals, etc. The fact that almost everyone is vaccinated leads me to believe that we’ll get to lime or green in about a month but we’re not getting spring break to avoid a repeat of thanksgiving travel problems.

Based on Cornell's recent covid numbers we could easily expect 5-30% of a class to be quarantining at a given time (if we still have quarantine restrictions). Best way we can get out of this by end of J-term is the whole country acquiring herd immunity through exposure to omicron, but it's unclear just how much a load that will put on the hospitals and how much more exposure is needed to reach that point.\n\nRemember, the ultimate limiting factor is hospital occupancy. Right now most/all inpatient elective procedures are being cancelled and many OR rooms and being converted to ICUs. Harvard has political motivations to not contribute to adding additional case numbers and potentially contributing to hospital overload.\n\nThat said, we absolutely cannot do another lab shutdown for graduate students/lab research.

Things you can get at Costco for a great deal that you might want for your dorm:\n   * Red plastic cups\n   * Foldable tables of different sizes (e.g. table for pong)\n   * All sorts of microwave-ready foods that you can store for a while (e.g. ramen)\n   * Tissues if you get a runny nose a lot, toilet paper if the 1 ply tp they provide for free at Harvard isn't good enough for you\n   * Bathmats and rugs\n   * Pillows\n   * Hangers\n   * TV\n   * Chairs & ottomans\n   * fleece blanket\n   * Microwave popcorn (it's good and way cheaper than what they sell at CVS)\n   * Mini fridge\n   * Pack of Band-aids\n   * A lot of the stuff mentioned in this comment\n\nEveryday carry:\n\n* Stain remover pen (I'm a messy person lol, but it's the easiest way to prevent that stain on your shirt from becoming permanent when you have to go to class right after lunch)\n* Small pack of tissues\n* Hand sanitizer\n* Pencils and pens\n* Laptop\n* Planner\n* Mini notebook for writing down anything and everything\n* Water bottle"", 'score': 13, 'created_utc': 1620671567.0}, {'author': 'None', 'body': '[deleted]', 'score': 28, 'created_utc': 1620623202.0}, {'author': 'Clarkmilo', 'body': 'I carry nothing bro this shit is virtual', 'score': 15, 'created_utc': 1620632350.0}, {'author': 'southpaw413', 'body': 'I live in a much lower COL area than cambridge and I’m not wealthy so I buy pretty much all of the necessities that I will need for the year ahead of time and bring them with me.

If you take it from the math department, make an effort to go to the section taught by the course head as opposed to the teaching fellow led classes.\n\nI’d only recommend a freshman seminar if you get into one that you are really excited about.

I personally took 21a (1st semester) and 21b (2nd sem.) as a freshman (Multivar Calc. and Linear Alg. respectively) which I really enjoyed and I’ve heard a lot of bad things about Math 1b (Single Variable Calc.) so I recommend Math 21a and 21b.\n\nIn addition to a math class, I recommend taking a physics or a science class. I took LS1a first semester (gen. chem) and LS1b second semester (genomics, genetics, biology) but I know people who’ve taken a physics course instead. However, you could also take an intro engineering course. Many people take ES51 (intro to MechE) or ES50 (intro to EE) however there’s other intro engineering classes like ES53 (intro to bioengineering) that may interest you. If you’re also interested in computer science, CS20 or CS50 (I took CS50 first semester - CS50 is a good intro to CS but can get very busy after the halfway mark) may also be good. I recommend taking 2-3 courses that go to your concentration each semester of first-year so if you do that (in addition to taking required classes like Expository Writing 20 or a Foreign Language and electives like a Freshman Seminar or GenEd), you should be in good shape. \n\nIf you want a little more guidance, each engineering concentration has a First-Year Exploration Page with recommended first-year classes.

Edit 2: I have been asked what specific tuition increase I'm referring to, here it is. In May 2021 I paid $1880 for a 4 credit HSS class. This year, that same class costs $3,500 ($2,120 if you are accepted into an ALB program). This means, The HSS tuition has increased 86% for non-enrolled students and 12% for enrolled students. A CNBC [study](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/27/college-tuition-is-now-rising-at-a-rate-lower-than-inflation.html) from October 2021 notes on average tuition and fees in US universities increased by 1.3%, making the Harvard increase excessive. Another [note](https://finaid.org/savings/tuition-inflation/) from [Finaid.org](https://Finaid.org) shows that tuition rates generally increase about 8% a year, which again makes the HSS increase excessive.

Edit: I have no idea why every single one of my responses are being downvoted. Listen, at HES, we're not the kids of hedge-fund managers, and some of us want to get a degree. But increasing tuition by 75% means we have to start over at another institution because it is no longer affordable.

Whereas before the virus you might have had a weekly homework/problem set/ reading assignment, now 4 of my 5 classes assign work to be done throughout the week, it's not more difficult to do, but just more difficult to organize. 

For example, I'm taking one course right now that assigns weekly readings, normal right?

What varies between them is their specific areas of interest and driven-ness, and their “speed.”  By the end of four years, you’re very likely to find lasting, interesting friends who are “your speed.”  (I am 10 years out and still have that group. My speed is “driven and accomplished but not winning any Nobel prizes or Olympic medals” and on the chiller, more affectionate side. The group formed slowly through all 4 years and by now we have 10-14 years of shared memories together). \n\nCampus: I loved having a storied, historical, meaningful and beautiful place as my own.

As a student I felt pretty satisfied with dorm room parties and hanging out with friends socially. I made friends, and had fun for sure.

I\'m not even talking about alcohol fueled frat parties, getting blackout drunk and hooking up with tons of strangers (though Harvard\'s aggressively asexual student population is its own issue - it\'s telling how many people graduate still a virgin compared to other, more social colleges.

I'm an incoming law student this fall and wanted to get a sanity check from all of u Cambridge veterans. I'm sorry for the vague and nooby nature of these questions, but I've never actually hunted for apartments or even dorms.

Seeing the rent rates in Cambridge coming from a mid-size Midwestern city is quite jarring; is $2000+ really a fair rate throughout Cambridge for a studio apartment?

Are there any Harvard-specific peculiarities in the housing process I should be aware of? If any of you are from the Midwest, what would you recommend for me to look out for in terms of particularly drastic changes in lifestyle/climate?

Also, while I'm here I figure I'll ask, even though no one possibly has an answer: what's you guys' ascertainment of the administration's attitude towards potentially returning to campus this fall? I go to a large state school that never really vacated campus except for the tail-end of spring 2020 (i.e. students are still living on campus and going to physical, albeit altered/hybrid classes), but I understand that Harvard's approach has been more cautious.

355,ej6w8z,None,32.0,0.91,28,Harvard,"(TLDR at the bottom) Hi I’m was recently accepted REA to Harvard, but I’m actually pretty worried about attending the school. I don’t want to be rude or call anyone out, but I’m afraid of Harvard’s social sphere. A fair share of posts in this subreddit are about how lonely and sad Harvard students feel, the lack of a dating life, and so on. This just kinda worries me a bit. I kinda hoped getting into Harvard was like this golden ticket and life would be all butterflies and rainbows after I started college. Obviously, this was super naive, but now it seems like it might even be the opposite. I already struggle with sadness and loneliness right now and I’d hate for college to amplify them. 

I’m already somewhat introverted. In high school, I finally made some solid friends, but it took until senior year for me to find them.  I’m afraid that finding friends at Harvard might take too long. I wish I thought of this earlier because by now it’s too late to apply to other schools, specifically MIT. MIT seems like it might be a better fit for me (I want to study comp sci and am pretty nerdy in liking engineering), but the all-nighter horror stories and my annoying mit tour guide scared me away from applying, which I now sincerely regret. MIT seems to have a ton of sciencey, nerdy people that I get along well with. So far all the Harvard people I met are super into social justice, liberal arts, and debating, which is fine and cool, but not really the kind of people I associate with.

Also, a minor point about the people, everyone seems to be way more accomplished than me by just looking at their Instagram pages. Imposter syndrome is already coming in hot :(

Finally, sports are a minor issue I have about Harvard. I was hoping to play my sport at Harvard, but even if I could play, the D1 level of athletics seems very hard core and I don’t know if I could handle it, if even afforded the opportunity. I am aware of club options, but I don’t know much about it. 

I should also state that I am still almost certainly coming to Harvard. I didn’t really apply to any school that I would choose over Harvard. I really just want to know how I can make sure the social life goes well for me. I realize that it might be early to start worrying about this since I haven’t even been at Harvard for one day, but I’d rather be prepared for the worst. Thanks

TLDR: I am going to Harvard in the fall, but I’m afraid that a sciencey introvert like me will have trouble making friends, dating, and not getting depressed. It might be early to worry about this, but I’d like to know about all I can in advance. Any advice on how to avoid that would be super appreciated.","[{'author': 'be_more_bmore', 'body': 'Silly OP, how could you worried that you will have trouble making friends at Harvard?

Psets are worth like 60% of the grade in the class, and the midterms are take-home, so if you're at the level of math where you can take and finish the class, you'll probably get a good grade, even if you don't understand a lot of the material.\n\nAs another commenter said, many students who take it don't drop because they can't handle the class, but because they don't want to commit the 20 hours a week or so to math. Once you have the mathematical maturity to take Math 55, the only thing that stops you from taking the class is your willingness to spend most of your semester on math. That's why they say don't take it unless you want to spend the bulk of your semester on math or you are seriously considering a career in mathematics.\n\nI don't even think you need to be a genius to take it. I would say most STEM students (in Computer Science and Applied Math, especially, at Harvard would be able to take the class as a sophomore or junior or if they had more background beyond high school math before coming to college.

I was the worst student in the class my year and the professor called me to his office and told me to drop the class. Now, being my stubborn self, I refused to do that and stuck it out and yeah - it was over my head. In retrospect, I would say if I had been adequately prepared, the class would have been fine, though a lot of work. In the end, I am happy I took the class and I use the material frequently in my day job. It also basically showed me that I didn't want to do a math undergrad (did Physics instead). The best part about it is probably hanging out with the other people class - they're usually a great bunch and extremely smart.

The pain seemed like the point of the course. Regarding this, the professor told that joke about a man repeatedly hitting himself with a hammer (punchline: Because it feels so good when I stop!).  Through problem sets we learned about really advanced topics like the de Rham cohomology of a manifold, but really quickly and not in any particular depth.  It seemed more like competition math than academics, and the macho attitude about competitions probably was related to the course’s atrocious gender imbalance (maybe just 1 or 2 women). \n\nI had a friend that year (now a very successful mathematician himself) who simply skipped 55 entirely in favor of upper-division courses in topology or algebra.

The long p-setting hours and take-home midterms/exams in 55 might be time consuming, but if you are prepared to spend as long as you need to understand ideas/ do your work outside of class (which works well for night-owls especially) then 55 is great.

I don't know how many of you are interested in Brazil, but the country has seen some quite conspicuous attacks on democracy recently, particularly on the education system. The government is planning to decentralize resources to social sciences and humanities - especially philosophy and sociology. Last week, the Ministry of Education announced that it would cut 30% of all federal universities' budgets. These are the leading research institutions in the country.

In response, a colleague and I in the department of sociology at Harvard wrote a letter in support of Brazilian sociology. In one week, we reached more than 10000 signatures from academics and other people who care about education across the globe, from countries like Brazil, Mexico, England, Zambia, Argentina, Lesotho, Japan, Israel, South Africa, and many, many others.

We, the organizers, and a professor in the department gave an interview to the Crimson last week. We explain the letter's goals and a little about what has been going on in Brazil.

P.S.

With that being said, it was also my impression that if you get into Harvard you are almost certainly capable of studying anything you really want to try. One of my favorite things about the school was not deciding my concentration until the sophomore year.', 'score': 22, 'created_utc': 1589949686.0}, {'author': 'Vermillionbird', 'body': ""imho, you'll get the best undergrad experience if you treat it like an opportunity to explore new things, rather than an exercise in checking off achievement boxes along a predefined, comfortable path of the known."", 'score': 6, 'created_utc': 1589984755.0}, {'author': 'crharvard', 'body': 'This is a really good question. I say, like in all situations, it depends on your background and what you\'re trying to break into. Generally, I think that it is easier, logistically, to explore new things at Harvard than at most other schools. Most concentrations don\'t have too many requirements, so you have lots of room in your schedule to take electives in new fields and explore a lot during freshman and sophomore year. Additionally, so many people end up switching concentrations, and this tends to be easy at Harvard because as long as you can show that you have the prereqs, time, and room to satisfy a concentration\'s requirements, you can switch (whereas many other places will make you formally transfer departments in a selective application process). Hell, I know someone who switched their concentration senior fall. \n\nHowever, I still think exploration and switching around is, in many ways, actually more difficult at Harvard. Some fields more than others, particularly Math and CS, benefit very much from early exposure and practice no matter where you go. When you combine this with the fact that at Harvard, you\'re likely to find those who were some of the *best in the world* at those fields in high school, it can feel demoralizing when you first begin your journey. Then additionally combine this with the fact that courses at Harvard tend to be more rigorous than those at lower ranked schools. This can make things pretty difficult. For example, I was super into physics in high school, but when I came here, I started to grow interest in Electrical Eng and CS. I felt soooo stupid all the time in those classes (I already felt dumb enough in physics anyway). I don\'t think I was actually dumber than the average EE or CS student, I just had less experience and was taking classes that were already difficult on their own with people who lived and breathed this stuff in high school and during their whole time in college.\n\nThis definitely tends to more pronounced in hard STEM fields, really. I think it\'s a lot easier to explore interests in the social sciences or humanities with a STEM background than vice versa. It\'s not uncommon to find someone who later gets dissuaded from hard STEM and claim they took ""the easy way out"" by switching to Econ or Gov. Of course I am not at all saying those are necessarily easy fields but that there are many more easy ways to do Econ or Gov versus ""easy"" ways to do CS or Physics or Math etc (but there are still super hard ways to study Econ).\n\nConversely, you\'ll be hard pressed to find someone who, after mostly studying a social science or humanities field, ends up getting a Math degree or related. It\'s not that they weren\'t capable of studying Math, but Math more so than I think every other field really benefits from early exposure (most Math concentrators start with Math 25, and if you\'re not at that level freshman year, it can be hard to get there later on). And personally, when I think about how much I\'ve struggled with my physics degree at Harvard, even after winning awards and doing research starting in high school, I can\'t even imagine what it must be like to experience physics for the first time at Harvard. More than just pure content, the style of thinking necessary in STEM fields and your mathematical maturity is something that you slowly develop over time.\n\nThis does suck, but I think it\'s good to understand early on that the barriers surrounding certain fields of study are higher than others. Knowing this, you\'re better able to manage expectations of your performance when you will inevitably encounter challenges and come across people whose abilities blow your mind. And as a prefrosh, you are at the position where it is easiest to jump around and explore other fields of interest, but this gets much harder to do with each year that passes by in college. I still ended up getting a CS secondary, and funny enough I feel even though CS is one of those aforementioned fields, so many people at Harvard end up switching to it anyway. If you think you want to explore CS and Econ at Harvard but you don\'t have experience in them, it doesn\'t hurt to dabble in that right now and do some early prep. For CS and more quantitative Econ, it\'s really important to improve your mathematical skills, so work on that, too. \n\nEDIT: Just to add more personal examples to my already excessively long comment: Throughout my years, I\'ve taken super interesting upper level electives in History, Econ, Gov, and English and didn\'t feel like my academic background held me back (i.e. I did not need to complete whatever standard intro sequence exists for those concentrations).

See Pro Publica and Reason for discussion and examples. Let’s review some examples from Williams history:\n\n> January 1993: Three (anti-black) racist slurs posted on the door of Rice House. Perpetrator turned out to an African-American student. He was suspended for one semester.\n\n> September 2001: Female student reports that she was assaulted in her dorm room. Turns out that she made the whole thing up. I do not think that this truly qualifies as a hate hoax since her intent was probably not to stir up a campus controversy about sexual assault. See discussion below for whether or not the intent of the perp should matter for defining an event as a hate hoax.\n\n> November 2011: Racist note — All Niggers Must Die — attached to a door in Prospect House. Perpetrator was (almost certainly) an African-American/Hispanic student activist. She was not punished and, to this day, the College maintains the public fiction that this was an actual hate crime.\n\n> November 2012: Racist statement — All beaners must die — written on whiteboard in Mission. Perpetrator was of “Mexican descent.” As best I can tell, the student was not punished.\n\n> November 2016: Racist graffiti — AMKKK, “meant to signify AmeriKKKa, a spelling of America that references racism in our society” — written in red paint in Griffin Hall. Three first year female African-American students were caught, all claiming (plausibly!) to have no connection to the KKK. Students were suspended but did return to Williams.\n\n> Are there other examples I should include?\n\n> As best I can tell, there are about as many hate hoaxes at Williams as there are actual hate crimes. What do readers estimate the proportions to be?\n\n> Even the hate crimes that do not seem to be hoaxes — Williams E in 2008, Mills-Dennett 1 in 2009 and Paresky 2014 — often seem to be driven by animus whose original source has nothing directly to do with hate . . . but that is a discussion for another day.\n\nI think insinuating that most hate crimes are actually perpetrated by the victims themselves is.... not the best thing. Jeez.\n\n---\nEDIT: another verbatim quote:\n\n>“Committing crimes,” and almost everything else, is heavily influenced by your genes. Blood will tell. Does Cass not know about this literature? Does he really think that it all comes down to “values and beliefs?” Or does he know and disagree?

Is this an issue always at Harvard? Yes. But it's a bit less tolerable due to Covid-19.

I know, this may sound rude to Cambridge residents and visitors - but I'm a student. I have four classes. And my WiFi where I live is **awful**. I walk to campus every day or so because it's the nearest place that I can walk that has WiFi and a great place to social distance. The Harvard WiFi is God-tier power.

Plus, for students like me - being on campus helps me 'get out' and feel like life is 'normal' somewhat again. But seriously, the WiFi.

However, the locals, tourists and people with their (screaming) children are making it harder and harder to be here and keep a distance. I've had children come up to where I'm working and start yelling to each other even though I'm 50 yards (at least) from the nearest person and any usual tourist object of interest. I've been bumped into by tourists walking into me from behind me.

I've had visitors get right up on me because they think it's an ideal selfie spot.

People who are not students are hanging around and getting way too close no matter where you are.

Yesterday, I saw a woman let her child **urinate** on the grass in the middle of the Old Yard. Where people (like me) sit and study.

In short - students have a reason to be here - you (random families, tourists, locals who consider Harvard a 'park') **do not**. Not during this semester, I mean.

*I write today to announce that we will gather as a community online on Thursday, May 27, to award degrees and celebrate the achievements of our graduates. After degrees are conferred, each School at Harvard will follow up with its own special virtual event and afterward deliver diplomas through the mail. More details will be shared by the* [*Commencement Office*](http://commencement.harvard.edu/2021) *as they become available.*

*The delay of our Commencement Exercises for two years running is deeply disappointing, but public health and safety must continue to take precedence. Though circumstances may well improve by spring, it takes months of planning to prepare for our usual festivities, which draw to campus and to Cambridge thousands of people from around the world. Right now, the risk posed by that possibility is too great, but please know that one day we will welcome the Class of 2020 and the Class of 2021 back to campus for an unforgettable—and unforgettably joyous—Commencement.*

*Fortunately, we learned last year that a virtual celebration can be meaningful and moving in its own ways. I am delighted to announce that* [*Ruth Simmons*](http://hvd.gs/321565) *will deliver our principal address. President Simmons—now at Prairie View A&M University after serving as president at both Smith College and Brown University—is among America’s foremost advocates for higher education. Having led a women’s college, an Ivy League research university, and a historically black university, she has a unique perspective on how very different types of institutions contribute to the fabric of our nation. She has also defended with great passion the possibility of improving our society by learning from our differences. I very much look forward to hearing her remarks later this year.*

*Thank you, as always, for your goodwill and patience as we continue to meet the challenges created by the pandemic. We are fortunate that it is now possible to imagine the day our graduates will file into Tercentenary Theatre once again, lifted by long-awaited applause in the good company of their family and friends. Until then, keep hope and take care.*

>	The lawsuit Students For Fair Admissions v. Harvard University provided an unprecedented look at how an elite school makes admissions decisions. Using publicly released reports, we examine the preferences Harvard gives for recruited athletes, legacies, those on the dean’s interest list, and children of faculty and staff (ALDCs). Among white admits, over 43% are ALDC. Among admits who are African American, Asian American, and Hispanic, the share is less than 16% each. Our model of admissions shows that roughly three quarters of white ALDC admits would have been rejected if they had been treated as white non-ALDCs. Removing preferences for athletes and legacies would significantly alter the racial distribution of admitted students, with the share of white admits falling and all other groups rising or remaining unchanged.

To absolutely no one’s surprise, legacy and athlete preferences heavily favor white admits.

From Garett Jones on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/GarettJones/status/1174854175378874368):

>	Controlling for academic traits and much else, being Asian American predicts a substantially lower probability of Harvard admission… And being female predicts a substantially higher probability of admission.

[Here is a fascinating table from the paper](https://i.imgur.com/cdyKuxP.jpg) that for some reason isn’t really mentioned in the abstract. One thing that surprised me is that if Harvard removed *all race, legacy and athlete* preferences, the number of white admits would actually rise. Unsurprisingly, Asian admits would skyrocket while African-American and Hispanic admits would tank.

Compared to older students who may need to be on campus for research, recruiting, etc., you may not have as much to lose from an online semester. That said, half of the value of a Harvard education is found in experiences that take place outside of the classroom. Friendships, extracurriculars, networking -- those are things you can\'t necessarily replicate online. I\'m not sure what you\'re looking to do on campus, but I know personally that none of my extracurriculars translate well to Zoom. And screw all the curmudgeons commenting on Crimson articles that ""spoiled Harvard students"" need to suck it up and accept that the university doesn\'t revolve around us -- we and our families have sacrificed so much to attend Harvard, and there\'s nothing spoiled or selfish about wanting to be able to take full advantage of its opportunities.\n\nSomething additional that we both need to consider: if we were to take time off, would we be guaranteed a spot in spring 2020 or fall 2021? I don\'t think we know yet.

With everything going on, I completely understand any guesses at this point are pure speculation. But, I suspect some of you are substantially more informed on this than me. I know Harvard accepted 30 more people this year (1980) to maybe account for any covid-19 related deferrals or offer refusals. My question is how much will those 30 more admitted students affect the usage of the waitlist this year. 

Last year, 65 people were accepted off the waitlist. Any chance that number will be higher this year. And if so, how much so? Something interesting to note is that school who historically haven't utilized waitlist at all like Princeton and Dartmouth started to pull from the waitlist before May 1. And, UPenn dean of admissions openly announced, a few days after ivy day, that he predicted they would heavily use the waitlist this year. Granted, these schools don't have the yield Harvard has historically had, but its still weird how they resorted to the waitlist that early when they haven't admitted anyone off it in years past.

I've been talking to a lot of admits, and many seem quite adamant in taking gap years if there is an online or hybrid semesters. By defer, I don't mean giving up the offer of admissions, but rather doing '25. If students did that, Harvard would just fill those vacated spots with waitlisted people. This seems like the only logical reason why a school like Princeton would go to waitlist this early when they didn't even use it last year.\n\n Also, compounded with the incoming recession, wouldn't that also contribute to smaller enrollment across the board, and thus more waitlist movement. Obviously, the recessions wouldn't have as large of an impact on the ends of the income brackets, in terms of ability to pay tuition, as much as it would for the average middle class working family. For low income admits, Harvard would meet full need, as it is the richest school in the world, and recession or not, the very wealthy still have the means to pay for school. It is the middle class that have to make financial sacrifices due to partial aid that I see being most affected. Do you think these admits could contribute to a situation causing lower enrollment?

417,a64il6,HarvardDating,479.0,0.96,25,Harvard,"Congratulations, you were admitted to Harvard. You're one of us, but with great power comes great responsibility. I'm not talking academic responsibility, but properly respecting the Harvard name. We're a special breed. People are out to get us, and it's the job of all of us to maintain the prestige behind the name.

You've probably already ordered your Harvard, Champion brand hoodie from the Coop. You made a good choice, it's the best hoodie. But the next time you're at Chipotle and wearing it alongside your friends going to Brown, Cornell, or worse, *Yale,* do you know how to properly address the fact that yes, you do in fact go to Harvard?

Here's a little guide of the time tested responses to the typical situations Harvard students may find themselves in having to discreetly explain that you're better than whomever you may be speaking to.

**Ordering at Starbucks:** If you're getting a hot drink, make sure you ask for one of the red holiday cups. If they ask why, just a simple ""I'm a Harvard student"" will do the trick. They may give you a funny look, but it's jealousy, don't worry about it. Persist until you get your red cup, you wouldn't want to be seen with a green cup and have people think you go to Dartmouth.

**Talking to a parent's friend:** Your parents are going to brag about you. Get used to it, it's the rest of your life. You need to lean to embrace it. Play the offence. Ask them where their children are going to college, such that you have the upper hand in saying ""I'm attending Harvard in the fall."" You don't want to be cornered. You'll receive an array of responses. ""That's very impressive, your parents must be so proud!"" Tell the truth, don't beat around the bush. ""It is, and they are"" is the only proper response. Veritas means truth, after all.

**On a date:** This one is tricky. Being self confident is important. It's good to let them know in the first few minutes, primarily to quickly figure out if they're a Yalie. The easiest option is to buy Harvard socks, and as soon as you meet, go down to tie your shoe. Your pant leg will rise, and their eyes will be drawn to your socks. It's discrete, but a good power move.

**Being asked about college but you're unsure how to mention you go to Harvard:** This one takes work. People can sense the Harvard on you, but they'll often ask for confirmation. The easiest option is to say ""I'm a student at the college."" Don't mention Harvard at first. This is to establish that once they ask ""which college?"" it's implied that they should have assumed Harvard. If they ask what you're studying, philosophy is the best answer. They're expecting finance, but philosophy will help further establish your intellectual dominance over them. Also, remember, it's **concentration**, not major.

**Talking to your friends:** Your friends already know you're superior to them, but a bit of consoling for their admittance to Bowdoin or Wesleyan won't kill you. ""That program there is great"" is a good response to their concerns. Don't mention the discrepancy in endowment size, unless reassuring them that no college really needs more than 2bn anyway (make sure your fingers are crossed behind your back, just to be safe). If you're missing them, make sure you go visit them. You don't want them seeing how much better you have it, and besides, it gives you more opportunities to tell their friends where you go to school.

I'm sure you've all updated your Facebook/Instagram/Tinders already, but make sure to do so now if you're yet to. You're going to have a great two years here before you start your business and drop out, make sure to make the most of them.

Luckily, there are some solutions for this conundrum that will allow you to continue to flex in your virtual classes.

* Headphones

Since people will only be able to see your upper body, headphones are the obvious go-to. Your Bose or Sony's won't cut it anymore, you need something that displays your true status. My recommendation is the [Sennheiser Orpheus.](https://en-us.sennheiser.com/sennheiser-he-1) Coming in at just shy of $60,000 they serve as a good starting point for displaying your wealth and status. The disadvantage is that you won't be able to claim you missed hearing something in class, forcing you to actually pay attention for once, but it's a small price to pay for the amount of drip they come with.

* Your background

Hopefully you've beat the rush and already reserved the [AirBnB penthouse in Manhattan](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/33279205?location=Manhattan%2C%20New%20York%2C%20NY&adults=1&check_in=2020-04-22&check_out=2020-04-30&source_impression_id=p3_1583846555_GQPQOEZl0kOpVvF4) you're staying at until your summer internship starts. Robot concierge included to prevent infection. Sitting by the window for your classes here reminds everyone that it's worth paying over $1,000 per night for the luxury of not having to be around the sickly. A way to increase your flex is to step away from class halfway through to grab the Peking duck you ordered from Seamless for lunch. Just make sure the driver leaves it at the door so you don't have to see them, let alone talk to them.

* Jewelry

A bonus is getting a custom Harvard piece commemorating the occasion, which shouldn't take too long to produce if you already have a jeweler on retainer.

There are many other subtle ways to remind your classmates of your superiority during this transition to virtual classes, but I hope this serves as a good starting point for those of you unsure of where to start due to the sudden shift to distance education. **Most importantly,** make sure to remind any Extension students you might come into contact with that your virtual classes are more legitimate and educational than theirs. They should know this already, but a gentle reminder never hurts.

419,cmztpo,HarvardDating,79.0,0.94,5,Harvard,"While students at other institutions may spend their time thinking about their grades, future careers, or their LinkedIn, Harvard students have a unique set of problems they face: **How to complete the three traditions as quickly as possible.**


No, going as a Yalie for your first Halloween in Cambridge isn't a tradition, but looking around you'll be led to believe it is. The three traditions I'm talking about, of course, are having sex in the stacks, peeing on John Harvard, and participating in the Primal Scream. While STEM concentrations may think they're too busy to do any of this, or that people couldn't *actually* be having sex in Widener, us social science concentrations are well aware of the social pressures put onto every student here to partake in these traditions prior to graduating.

If you're determined, any dedicated Harvard student can complete the trifecta of traditions in less than 10 minutes. Luckily, since typically [65% of the matriculating class are virgins,](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/09/harvards-class-2017-full-virgins-and-thats-okay/311342/) none of you should have any problem completing **step one: having sex in the stacks** in a matter of minutes. The hardest part of this is agreeing on which section to practice procreation in. While Greek Philosophy is a popular one, I typically choose the *Love Languages* section, just to set the mood a bit.

Once you've completed the first task and left Widener, you should have about 7 minutes left, which is more than enough time to get over to the John Harvard statue. This step is arguably the most important, as **step two: peeing on John Harvard** doesn't only serve to complete the tradition, but is an important measure to take in order to prevent UTIs. Depending on the equipment of your partner you may have to give them a lift, or help each other up, but synchronizing streams, while not necessary, is certainly preferred.

Conveniently, this act can be used to kill two birds with one stone, and **step three: the Primal Scream** is generally an involuntary reaction to the burning sensation you feel while peeing on John after having sex with a stranger in the stacks. Be sure to make it a good one, this is your moment. Everyone's eyes are on you, people are leaning out of Thayer to cheer you on, and they want to hear a walloping, unadulterated scream. Similar to step two, this is a good opportunity to team up with your partner and harmonize a bit. Give the Krokodiloes a run for their money.

After dismounting from the statue, you should have just under a minute left, which is just enough time for the two of you to decide which of you is running to the HEM, and which to Malkin, for you both to shower the shame off. Shake dry hands, congratulate each other, and begin sprinting your separate ways into the night.","[{'author': 'None', 'body': '[deleted]', 'score': 31, 'created_utc': 1565147688.0}, {'author': 'KantianCant', 'body': 'Assuming that we’re all capable of finding a sexual partner is blatant discrimination against STEM students, smh. \n\nTrue allies wouldn’t perpetuate the structural oppression inherent in concepts like “people have social skills” and “a sex life is more than just masturbation.” \n\nSTEM bois unite against the chadrarchy!', 'score': 35, 'created_utc': 1565145339.0}, {'author': 'aaaalllleeeexxxx', 'body': ""I don't know about ten minutes, but I have it on good authority that one can complete all three traditions within 24 hours."", 'score': 6, 'created_utc': 1565148434.0}, {'author': 'Mzrog', 'body': 'That’s not what primal scream is tho', 'score': 3, 'created_utc': 1565194236.0}, {'author': 'jbhard', 'body': 'J Harv is gold the morning after', 'score': 6, 'created_utc': 1565153065.0}, {'author': 'KantianCant', 'body': 'J Harv is always gold', 'score': 5, 'created_utc': 1565165605.0}]","{'neg': 0.067, 'neu': 0.812, 'pos': 0.12, 'compound': 0.9814}",0.12,0.067,0.9814

I came from a public school and did not learn these skills. \n\nAs for studying (I was STEM and can’t say much about humanities), I would study a lot by myself, but later realized I can cover a lot more studying as a group. I tried videos, notes, anki... the important skills are active recall and spaced repetition, but also using your peers as a way to make sure you’re covering your bases. \n\nSet goals, meet nice people to work with. It’s better to struggle with friends than struggle alone. Every Thursday was an all-nighter with my friend as we furiously tried to finish the pset.\n\nWhat made me feel more confident was to tell myself that I deserved a seat at the table. I deserved to be comfortable around professors and freely ask questions or just say “I really don’t understand this.” Freshman year is hard! Be honest, take this year to make your mistakes. Good luck.', 'score': 8, 'created_utc': 1570647701.0}, {'author': 'rough-hewn', 'body': 'Reposting some hopefully useful comments I gave to an earlier post about someone who was struggling after their first semester:\n\nMy first semester grades of freshman year (waaaaay back in 1999) were, my worst of all of college. I kept them pretty steadily climbing every semester after to where I had mostly As with one or two A- grades late junior and senior years. I got my overall GPA up to a pretty respectable level and have had great opportunities since college.\n\nHere\'s what I learned that most helped me:\n\n1. Let go of all but one or two extracurriculars that demand major time/effort commitments (more than, say, an hour per week). You can stay on email lists and keep up with the interesting parts of the others, but don\'t let yourself commit to stuff. You mentioned an initial goal to try all possible opportunities at Harvard. In just four years a hundred people together couldn\'t take advantage of ALL Harvard has to offer; trying will just run you ragged. Now that you\'ve had some time to explore probably just a small sampling of those opportunities, pick a few and focus on the quality of that experience for yourself and others. How do you pick which ones to keep? I suggest choosing ones where you a) really enjoy the activities, b) care about their purpose, and c) enjoy spending time with the people. For most of my friends years after graduation the most meaningful part of the extracurriculars is the friendships they developed. Which groups do you want to nourish your friendships with most? If you\'ve taken all those factors seriously and STILL have too many to choose from, then consider which will best help you develop skills for careers that interest you.\n2. In terms of both classes and activities taken, try to balance your workload and pace yourself. Two tough classes this semester? Try to balance it out with some less challenging ones or scale back a bit on extracurriculars for a semester. You seem to have already diagnosed this issue so not too much to add here. Just realize that if you\'ve built a system that requires delicate balance, that also requires minimal disruption from outside forces. Midterms, romantic relationships, family situations, roommate drama, illness, all kinds of other things can be big disruptive forces. If you don\'t have a bit of ""slack"" to handle those unexpected increases in stress it\'s easy to get into a downward spiral.\n3. Take advantage of office hours. This totally deserves its own point; I wish I had picked up on this my freshman year. Your professors and TFs want you to succeed. They can often tell who\'s struggling but can\'t really come running to all of you. The easiest way for them to help is if you come to their office hours and get some help on part of a problem set that you\'re stuck on or when you\'re struggling with a topic on a paper. Even if they seem standoffish in lectures they\'re often very personable and helpful one-on-one. Go early, well before the deadlines, before you\'re panicking, before you\'ve wasted a bunch of energy banging your head against the desk. Don\'t ask for answers or special favors but do make it clear you want to understand the material and do well in the class. They can clear roadblocks, steer you in useful directions (e.g. ""that\'s not a very interesting paper topic but have you thought about this other angle on your idea?""), better signal what they care about in grading, and prevent SO much wasted effort in your work. Two other advantages: they\'ll better understand what some students (at least you) are struggling with and may be able to adjust their lectures to be more helpful for you. You\'ll also often build good relationships with them that yield other cool opportunities. In my junior year I regularly visited the professor\'s office hours for my Thermodynamics class. I was not at the top of the class but at the end he asked me whether I\'d like to be a TF the following year, which turned out to be a really awesome opportunity.\n4. Join or create study groups. Again this prevents you wasting time banging your head against the desk when someone else in the group can quickly help you see something you were missing. It also reduces your feeling that you\'re alone in finding things difficult and will hopefully give you a chance to help others. Helping others with their challenges often helped me learn the material better myself. In my time Prof. Morin had a Thursday night study session in the Leverett dining hall for his Physics class. He and one of his TAs would just be on hand for any questions. Lots of other science and math Profs did the same. About half the class showed up to work on problem sets together those evenings. Whenever a bunch of us were stumped one of us went to the Prof or TA for help to unblock us. Working in those groups helped me a ton and I made some good friends at the same time.\n5. Get help early. Meet with your proctor or freshman dean or whatever they have these days and tell them you had a tough semester and want to know what kinds of help is available going forward before you get into a panicked or bad situation. They will gladly open a ton of doors to people willing and eager to help you.', 'score': 3, 'created_utc': 1570659884.0}, {'author': 'gu5andr3', 'body': ""This is a time in your life where you will discover there's more to you than you ever knew."", 'score': 2, 'created_utc': 1570839135.0}, {'author': 'mackerel2', 'body': 'way off topic', 'score': -5, 'created_utc': 1570647251.0}, {'author': 'topsidersandsunshine', 'body': 'A lot of people struggle because they’re so used to being the smart kid in the classroom.

434,tvnh5c,Fit_Bobcat_2916,65.0,0.87,40,Harvard,"Hi! I’m an admitted student who’s deciding between Harvard and Yale. I am incredibly grateful to have such great options, and I want to hear from the students about the downsides of each school before I make my final decision.

General info: I’m planning to major in Classics. Yale has been my dream school since 7th grade and I worked on a research paper with a professor there. I love how approachable the professors are. When I visited Yale after Ivy Day, I met up with that professor whom I've worked with, and he offered to show me all around the department and genuinely wanted me to go there. I was deferred by Yale when I applied REA but got in during RD, which make me think that maybe the AOs do not think that I would fit at Yale. Yale has great humanities programs, but I also feel like it is a bit like a bubble, where students, especially humanities students, just read and write and do not engage with the local community as much.

On the other hand, Harvard offered me a likely letter in February, which not only made me feel like Harvard genuinely wants me, but also gave me a chance to stay at Harvard for most of my spring break. I have met some amazing ppl via group chats, and some of my friends from high school have committed to MIT (so we will be close)! Harvard have a ridiculously strong Classics department, which is also twice the size of the Yale one. Plus, Boston is always a win compared to New Haven. But I am afraid that Harvard will be too competitive and cutthroat, and that the professors would not be as approachable.

I’m looking for the good and especially the bad of both schools — not to hate on one or the other, but only to gain perspectives that I will not get from the Admission Office.

I’d appreciate anything!

Edit: I guess I missed the point in this post: I want to hear from the students their raw experiences, good and bad, at Harvard (and Yale). I am leaning towards Harvard at this point.

For me, rational comparison of the two schools only got me so far. I had to visit and assess where I instinctively felt more at ease, more comfortable, and more excited about learning.\n\nThat place happened to be Yale, in my case. I can't entirely explain why, but it was obvious to me after spending time there and interacting with the student body. At Harvard, on the other hand, I felt rootless and a bit out of place. You might have the exact opposite experience. This stuff is highly personal! So I'd strongly recommend that you don't pull the trigger until you have a first-person aperture into both schools.\n\nWith the benefit of postgraduate hindsight (class of '21), I do think Yale was a good environment for me. I was an extremely sheltered and sensitive kid, and I struggled a lot, socially, with the transition to college. Boy, did I have some learning to do in that domain. Being part of a smaller student body and getting to know my seminar professors, rather than getting tossed into big lectures, was vital for me. I'm sure another person, however, would feel similarly thankful for Cambridge's urban bounty and Harvard's liveliness. It comes down to taste.\n\nOne specific thing to add: I'm not quite sure what your particular interests are, but I'll note that at the current moment, my sense is that Yale's Classics department has a somewhat stronger showing of Latinists (Freudenburg in poetry, Kraus in historiography, Lenski in politics, Inwood in philosophy) while Harvard's department has stronger scholars of Ancient Greek (Elmer and Nagy in poetry, Weiss in drama, Kosmin in history, Angelov in Byzantine studies). That's much more relevant for a PhD student than an undergrad, who'd undoubtedly be well-served at either institution, but it sprang to mind. Flip through some recent course catalogues and see which one has more classes that grab your attention.\n\nYou can't go wrong, though. My first year or so of undergrad, I'd sometimes wonder how things might have shaped out had I attended Harvard instead.

The engineering community is SUPER tight knit since not too many engineers, which I loved.\n\nCons: engineering program isn’t as old so curriculums are sometimes not as organized, instructors are not the best, you have to go out of your way during recruiting szn while MIT has an engineering focused recruiting fair. If you are gung ho about being a technical wizard or a really really amazing engineer, MIT is going to be better\n\nSpecifically mechanical: the intro classes are really not great, if you didn’t already have some mechanical experience it won’t be a fun time. But maybe they’ve changed after all the complaints. There’s not a ton of real world experience but not super problematic since you’ll get that through internships (ie I didn’t even know what Loctite was until I started interning)\n\nI’d choose Harvard over MIT again in a heartbeat.', 'score': 22, 'created_utc': 1614450069.0}, {'author': 'gbear0', 'body': 'Another pro of Harvard engineering is that you get to take advantage of the new Allston campus, Harvard’s state-of-the-art engineering complex that just opened in 2021.\n\nAdditionally, at Harvard, you also have the opportunity to befriend classmates from a plethora of disciplines.

So I got into Harvard and Brown. I have always LOVED Brown (I wanted my college to be played back and for me to take classes for just to enjoy them and take them as pass and fail so I can explore a lot of different areas without feeling too pressured) At Brown I was thinking I can also lay back when I need to if things become overwhelming. 

However, then I got into both. TBH I never really did research on Harvard (because I never thought I would get in and I was like oh people are so toxic, etc--which I now realize is not true!:)) I just applied to see what happens. Ever since I got in, I have been so scared because I feel like I should choose it but I feel like I am not made up for it. I go to a low income majority high school and we are really behind with classes, especially math. Majority of the kids drop out after high school or really struggle in college and everyone that takes APs almost always gets 1-2 here. I didn't get a single 4 or 5 on my AP Tests and my SAT was fairly low (didn't submit both). I am in AP Calc AB rn but tech it's more like pre calc because no one learned anything last year here so it's just trying to catch up. I am so scared that Harvard is going to go too fast and I will fail. I heard they do placement tests and I am ready to take the 2 semester math that's like precalc to catch up, but I am scared I will be too behind. I have been trying to learn more about Harvard since I got in and the resources seem like they are really good for First Gen and people do thrive from high schools like mine but are professors understanding? It also seems like a good environment and not the insanely dying place I have painted a picture of in my head.  If anyone here went to a similar high school background, please let me know and give me advice! If I do attend Harvard, I still want some freedom to take fun classes (I heard there are a few pass and fail classes so it would be great if anyone can talk a little about that). Also how is the social scene? How hard are the pre recs? And how are the midterms and finals? I will make sure to work hard ofc and reach out for help but I feel like I am going to be too behind. Are there group works? 

I had an AO interview and there I focused a lot on how I am going to have imposter in college (and how I am coming from a easy school) and the fact that I still got accepted is so shocking to me) But I have also been getting imposter syndrome because I don't know how I got into all the reaches I applied for cause my SAT was low 1000s, my writing wasn't the best, my AP scores were all 3s and one 1. I have been looking at people who got accepted and everyone is sooo smart. Also the people who got rejected had crazy stats. I was the only one from my high school who got into the hard colleges I applied to and I have just been questioning everything because I am not smart LOL and I feel like so many people deserved the place too. I am so scared haha. Sorry if I sound like a nervous freak.

I feel like I should use a throwaway for this (I'm pretty identifiable) but that's okay. 

I'm a first year student (college). I'm also international and have a disability - I'm blind - which doesn't help with all of this. I feel like no matter what I do, I can't find my place here.

I've tried talking to random people at Annenberg and I actually have people I could call my friends, but more than friends they are just people I hang out with and that's it. I feel like the relationships don't go any further. 

I also feel like I'm not taking advantage of everything Harvard has to offer- my flights were canceled so I got here late and when I did I caught Covid two days later, so I haven't been able to get involved in my extracurriculars this semester by attending meetings and such, and I feel like everyone else is doing so much more than me, or that I'm missing out on participating in clubs where I could actually meet nice, down-to-earth people (I'm not saying the ones I'm in the people aren't nice, but I feel like everything is so superficial and competitive...). 

I don't even know what I'm looking for by posting here, maybe advice or just knowing that I'm not the only one this is happening to, but it's all pretty overwhelming and I can't help but wonder if I really did the right thing by coming here.

I spent almost three decades playing music— touring the world, living overseas for long stretches at a time, doing a fair amount of teaching. For the last decade I've been working mostly in theater, to the point where I'm currently the Artistic Director of an emerging developmental theater company. But I've always felt that the lack of a formal degree was limiting.\n\nA bit over two years ago I decided to start at HUES. I thought the EXPO-25 course was the biggest mistake I'd ever made—my professor was great, but I wasn't prepared for how intense the requirements were. The feedback was sharp and spot-on, definitely not for the thin-skinned. And the attrition was completely unexpected—we lost six people after the first class meeting as their writing was deemed lacking, and one more of my classmates withdrew in the third week. But I did well, finished all of the entry requirements, and gained admission.\n\nSince then, as I said above, it's been life-changing. The advising staff is fantastic; responsive to questions, proactive with suggestions, and generally very supportive. The academic quality is first-rate all the way. I've taken a number of Harvard College classes in the unique way that HUES offers them, as live/recorded lectures with an HUES TF assigned; one of those classes set up discussion sections that included both college and HUES students. One course I took last semester was cross-registered at the T.H. Chan School of Public Health, HKS, and HUES.\n\nBut, to the question: the academic opportunity is what pursuing the ALB degree has changed for me. I'm transitioning out of the performing arts world into a parallel career with public policy, social science, and arts elements. I'm looking at graduate research in those areas at a few places; the admissions departments I've corresponded with are impressed that the HUES degree is both a Harvard degree AND that it's earned while working full-time—one professor told me that the fact of juggling both was more impressive in itself than any single thing she's seen on a grad school application. So, that's my experience.\n\nTo echo what a few other posts have pointed out, it's rare-to-nonexistent in my own experience to encounter someone treating the degree as some kind of second-rate education.

One of my biggest supporters as I've been juggling my schedule over the last few years is a Harvard College grad who works in my company, actually.

I'm moving to Cambridge/Boston as a postdoc in a few months (April). I was approved for Harvard Housing and ideally would like to live in Soldiers Field or one of the nearby residences. However, there are basically **no** properties coming up on the availabilities page.. And the ones that do come up have a lease start date for a week or so in advance, and even then are snatched up within a few hours... I was wondering if this is normal, and if I'm basically out of luck, or if I should continue to keep an eye out? Any advice, input would be appreciated.   


Thanks!","[{'author': 'Cormyll666', 'body': 'Housing in Boston is a total shitshow. HUH stuff usually goes well in advance. Best advice? 1. Check about subleasing through HUH. Might have luck there 2. Wherever you are coming from expect to pay more and get less to move here. Right now the limiting factor is availability. If you find something that is not a scam, you can swing rent-rise, and it’s physically safe? SNATCH IT UP. Sounds like you’re coming here off cycle (most leases are Sep to Sep) which means if you are very dutiful in your search you might get lucky but overall availability will be low since most of Boston is on September to September leases. \n\nOh, and the fun part is usually move in requires 3-4 months up front: first last and security but then also the broker fee. \n\nMost everyone I know was shocked—even those from NYC and places like Geneva Switzerland— at how challenging renting is here and how little one gets. \n\nI say all this because don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good. \n\nGOOD LUCK', 'score': 26, 'created_utc': 1671609763.0}, {'author': 'peebsthehuman', 'body': 'Hi there! I moved here last March and had the same issue. I had never been to Boston so I had to get a realtor/broker because I didn’t know the neighborhoods and knew they got first pick of when places got listed. My advice would be to get one!! Here are the big things I learned:\n\n1. You will likely need 4x your monthly rent to move in. Sometimes you’ll only need 3, and in very rare cases 2, but a lot of times listed places require first months rent, last months rent, a security deposit, and a brokers fee, all equal to the rent cost. \n\n2. Places go FAST. This is why a broker helps. I spent 3 weeks looking and applying at places before I finally got to my wits end and applied to my current place 2 minutes after it was listed. I moved in 4 days later.\n\n3. Because of this, places can be listed a week away from their move in date, just because they will reliably be rented out. \n\n4. MAKE NOTE OF THE HOUSING TYPE. I got very lucky in that regard, but a lot of housing in Boston/Cambridge is a nightmare to move in/out of. 4th floor walk ups, no elevator, tiny spiraling staircases that you can’t fit a queen size mattress up. \n\n5. It’s cold now, and Boston knows how to do cold. But don’t forget about the summer!!! A lot of places in Boston don’t have air conditioning. It’s not a big deal if you have a window AC unit, or a north facing apartment. But it was something I didn’t anticipate moving here from the south. My apartment is south facing and I don’t have AC so in the summer I use blackout curtains and a bunch of fans to help cool off. Not a major thing, but something I didn’t know moving here!\n\n6. If you have a car, it will need to be registered in Massachusetts THE DAY you move in. There is no grace period! Parking in Boston is a nightmare so you’ll need to register your vehicle, change your residency status, and get a parking permit for your neighborhood. I managed to buy myself a little time by slapping a handwritten sign on my car that explained I had just moved and was getting all that paperwork done still. Only one cop gave me a ticket! There is also street cleaning that happens every other week, so make sure you read the street signs so you don’t get towed. It’s a $250 towing charge plus a $90 ticket if it happens so it’s best to avoid it.\n\n\n\nIf you have any questions at all don’t hesitate to reach out.

This means that you\'ll meet absolutely brilliant people from schools you\'ve never heard of and vice-versa.

You are evidently brilliant in the ways that matters to this team; own it.\n* You\'re not fully prepared. For almost any job you will never be fully prepared when you interview. That\'s OK.

Initiative, ability to communicate clearly, work ethic. Sure, going to school at Harvard and graduating from Harvard give you substantive things you don’t get in any other college. But those can be out Sean by the factors that individual brings.\n\nI’ve done hiring. Believe me, they wouldn’t shoot themselves in the foot by choosing only a diversity hire. They have to live with their decision. \n\nIn the instances that my best choice also happened to be black, or Hispanic, or Asian, I recorded that as a big bonus for me – from a very selfish point of you. Because not only was I going to get someone who could do that job well, but I was now I’m going to be working with someone whose outlook was shaded differently than mine, who would have a perspective and a window onto issues that I know I’m unable to see. I work with words, and I need to be aware of how language hits many different communities, so if I happened to find a person of color as my best candidate, that was a bonus. It was the same kind of bonus that I would have if I had hired someone with lots of recipe editing experience, or someone who his last assignment was a business magazine (mine is not), or Who had worked at a much larger or much smaller organization.\n\nSo please don’t look at a diversity hire as a pity hire. I know that I am not alone in valuing diversity for the benefits it gives; it doesn’t come from some feeling of shame or guilt. It might come from a sense of justice, because I am pleased to see my fellow humans from a group that is often marginalized who are now moving ahead, moving forward, entering spaces that have in the past not included them. That makes me feel good; but it doesn’t come from pity. It comes from a belief in solidarity. \n\nSo even someone who is a diversity hire (and I am not saying that you are one) does not need to apologize for that.

I always thought it was weird; it just seemed that you got a very insular way of looking at the world, and that whatever our college did would simply be perpetuated instead of being leavened or accented with information, teaching styles, emphases, research that came from outside.

474,d3i3bx,BigCrim8810,37.0,0.96,7,Harvard,"Received at 9:20 pm, 9/12/19:

Dear Members of the Harvard Community,

All of us have been horrified by the revelations regarding Jeffrey Epstein, and I write today to update our community on steps we are taking in view of current information about his philanthropy to Harvard.

Let me start by emphasizing the obvious: Epstein’s reported criminal actions were utterly abhorrent. They flagrantly offend the values of our society and this institution, and we condemn them. We also recognize the profound pain that Epstein caused to his victims and their families, and we commend their courage in coming forward to bring his crimes to light.

Epstein’s connections as a donor to this University, and other institutions, raise important concerns. With that in mind, two weeks ago I asked for a review of his donations to Harvard. Our decentralization makes such a review more complicated than it would be at some other institutions. I want to emphasize that this review is ongoing. Our review to date indicates that between 1998 and 2007, Epstein made a number of gifts to support various faculty and institutional research activities across the University. The largest of these was a $6.5 million gift in 2003 to support the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics. The University received other gifts, which totaled approximately $2.4 million, based on current information. Each of these gifts from Epstein and his affiliated foundations to Harvard University predates his guilty plea in June 2008. To date, we have uncovered no gifts received from Epstein or his foundation following his guilty plea. Moreover, we specifically rejected a gift from Epstein following his conviction in 2008. We have also recently learned that Stephen Kosslyn, a former faculty member and a beneficiary of Epstein’s philanthropy, designated Epstein as a Visiting Fellow in the Department of Psychology in 2005. We are seeking to learn more about the nature of that appointment from Dr. Kosslyn, who no longer works at the University.

The majority of Epstein’s gifts were designated for current use, not as endowed funds, and nearly all were spent years ago for their intended purposes in support of research and education. Our ongoing review of these gifts has identified one current use fund and one small endowment designated to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences with a total unspent balance of $186,000. After consultation with the Dean of the FAS, we have decided that the University will redirect the unspent resources to organizations that support victims of human trafficking and sexual assault. This is an unusual step for the University, but we have decided it is the proper course of action under the circumstances of Epstein’s egregiously repugnant crimes. The issue of the gifts given to institutions by donors at Jeffrey Epstein’s suggestion, is also one that has emerged in recent days, and we are looking into this as part of our ongoing review.

Epstein’s behavior, not just at Harvard, but elsewhere, raises significant questions about how institutions like ours review and vet donors. I will be convening a group here at Harvard to review how we prevent these situations in the future. I also hope to engage our peer institutions to consider how we can collectively improve our processes. We can all learn from each other.

Let me end where I began. Jeffrey Epstein’s crimes were repulsive and reprehensible. I profoundly regret Harvard’s past association with him. Conduct such as his has no place in our society. We act today in recognition of that fact. And we do so knowing that the scourge of sexual assault continues to demand our close attention and concerted action.

Harvard is not perfect, but you have my commitment as president that we will always strive to be better.

Sincerely,
Lawrence S. Bacow

in a really crazy turn of events I got off of the Harvard waitlist yesterday. it still does not really feel real and I'm very excited about the opportunity.

I don't have too long to decide so I figured id come on here to ask a few questions. just to help with answers I'm currently committed to another school with a great business school for finance. at Harvard id primarily do Econ but id love to also do global affairs or something of the sort. as of right now Im interested in IB/consulting but I mean who knows in four years that might change.

questions:

I feel like I always hear about grade inflation at Harvard and I'm curious what its actually like. obviously I'm guessing it's difficult to do well in the classes there but do curves help a lot or something?

what is the atmosphere on campus like? above all I want a school that is collaborative among its classmates. does it becomes especially cutthroat between Econ majors who all want to be placed in big 3 consulting or the major IB?

in general, do most people who want to be placed on a Goldman Sachs-level IB or Bain-level consulting get it or is it still a relatively low percentage?

this last one is probably really dependent on who I ask but what is the work/life balance like? I'm sure the classes will be super difficult and require a large time commitment, but how is the social scene?

I think this is most of them but I'll edit this or something if I think of others

thanks!","[{'author': 'adviceguru25', 'body': '>I feel like I always hear about grade inflation at Harvard and I\'m curious what its actually like. obviously I\'m guessing it\'s difficult to do well in the classes there but do curves help a lot or something?\n\nGrade inflation does not correlate to the difficulty of the course material and how much time you\'ll be spending outside of class. Harvard classes will be difficult. However, grade inflation definitely exists here. Not to the extent that everyone will be receive an A or it is easy to receive to an A, but the reality is in most classes the overwhelming majority of grades tend to follow in the B+ to A range and it\'s rare for people to receive Cs (or lower) in classes (even though it does happen on occasion). Ultimately, if you focus on academics, you probably keep your GPA over a 3.6 here (the average for each graduating class is usually over/under 3.65), but there\'s no guarantee you\'ll get a 4.0 or anything.\n\n>what is the atmosphere on campus like? above all I want a school that is collaborative among its classmates. does it becomes especially cutthroat between Econ majors who all want to be placed in big 3 consulting or the major IB?\n\nHonestly, compared to what we hear from other schools, I would say Harvard students tend to be pretty collaborative and it\'s not super cutthroat or competitive. Others can feel free to disagree.\n\n>in general, do most people who want to be placed on a Goldman Sachs-level IB or Bain-level consulting get it or is it still a relatively low percentage?\n\nYou\'re not going to find an accurate percentage on Reddit and it\'s hard to find the exact and accurate numbers (unless you do the research yourself and actively attempt to hunt down each graduating senior\'s postgrad plans). However, I do believe saying that ""most"" reach that level would be an exaggeration. No matter what university you go to, getting into those kind of companies after undergrad is difficult and it\'s probably a low percentage. That said, we\'re at Harvard, and I would assume compared to other colleges and universities, that we\'re up there with having one of the highest percentages.\n\n>this last one is probably really dependent on who I ask but what is the work/life balance like? I\'m sure the classes will be super difficult and require a large time commitment, but how is the social scene?\n\nIt  depends on what classes you take and what is your major. I\'m planning to concentrate in CS, and from my first-year experience alone, it\'s definitively more work than life and my prospective sophomore year courses are supposed to be more difficult. However, CS is one of the most time-consuming majors. For Econ, I would believe there is more of a balance + (again) it really depends on how much you prioritize academics.\n\nFeel free to PM with more questions.', 'score': 19, 'created_utc': 1653159736.0}, {'author': 'and_dont_blink', 'body': ""There's no social scene, but the campus is leagues better than Notre Dame.

Many people right now are posting stuff like “I didn’t get punched, got rejected from an RSO, consulting club, you name it”. Rejection makes you feel terrible, like no one likes you. And that’s a normal human feeling, we all have an inner desire to feel wanted and cared for. 

Try to think about all this from a different perspective: a few thousand 18-21-year-old overachievers are going to the same school and sharing the same resources. People who, up until now, were the best of their class, and usually loved that attention. Getting awards and top internships makes you feel so good! People here are addicted to exclusivity. It makes you feel wanted, seen, and desired.

The late teens and early 20s are also crucial years for our development: first time living on your own, becoming responsible for your own life and future. In high school, life was pretty straightforward, but now you have to choose between tens of concentrations, 400 clubs, and thousands of career fields. 

Coming into Harvard, all of us had big dreams, and still do. That’s why we got in! But suddenly, we are together with hundreds of other people who are just as cool, so naturally, we start feeling insecure. We start getting anxious about not having the same control and clarity we had in high school. What would make you feel wanted again? Being a member of an exclusive club. Becoming friends with the next multibillion-dollar company founder behind closed doors. 

We all say we go to school near Boston, but I’m quite sure all of you feel pretty damn good about having Harvard on your resume. It’s something a lot of people around the world envy. But inside the institution, that isn't enough anymore to give you the feeling of being memorable and likable. 

So in my opinion, final clubs, a 10% acceptance rate to HCCG, and stuff like this are just products of deep insecurity in young adults trying to navigate the real world for the first time, which is a very natural thing, especially considering the pressurizing Harvard environment. Acknowledging this, my best advice is instead of just anxiously waiting for punch letters and spending hours and hours preparing for a student club's second or third round of interviews, start working on your root insecurities and fear of the future and rejection. It’s going to help you so much more in the long term than being in any club can. This is just the beginning of life, so you will benefit from cultivating a healthier mindset. And those of you who are already in those competitive clubs, I'm not blaming you for contributing to the toxic system, but also recommend thinking about your root motivations.

1. The first class for spring classes is on January 24th correct? This is my main time sensitive question as I need to give my 2 weeks notice at my current job and don’t know when students return to campus.

Does the lottery system for in-demand classes still happen at the end of shopping week?
