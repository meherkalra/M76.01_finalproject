After a long day, you just want to eat, but Cafe 3 is the only option.  You walk in and your options are 4 hour old pizza, tilapia and veggie medley, or the salad bar.  You choose the salad bar and fish because you want to be healthy.  You sit in the corner and eat half the food because it is literally undercooked.  Later that night, you shit your guts out for 4 days because you got Norovirus.   Now you're behind in class and have to play catch-up the rest of the semester, constantly worried if you're gonna pass.

&#x200B;

It's frankly embarassing for a ""prestigious"" university like Berkeley to be serving such abysmal food on the daily.  CalDining horror stories are nothing new and extend years into the past.  Not only is the food quality subpar (classics like Veggie Medley, Polenta, Tilapia, bug salad), I'm sure you've all seen someone or yourself get sick with Norovirus salad, or seen raw fish and meat.  I myself have seen  cockroaches scuttling around on the floor of Crossroads.  The only thing that was edible was cereal and milk (and looking at a recent post, even this isn't safe anymore).   CalDining also has issues with their staff, I'm not sure what exactly goes on and why they strike so much, but if things were fine I don't think they would.  It's obvious to anyone that CalDining is failing in multiple aspects.

We as students should push for better dining halls with very high quality food.  People will say it's expensive, but lots of us are paying a huge amount of money for seriously inedible food.  Imagine having high quality, safe-to-eat, delicious food at the dining halls.  Food waste will be minimized because people will actually be able to eat.  I saw so many people throw out whole plates of food because it's unsafe or just disgusting. Additionally, Cal's reputation as a university can only increase.  Everyone I know raves about UCLA's dining hall and how it's so amazing, with crepe bars, steak nights, pro chefs, etc.  That is an extremely convincing selling point for a lot of prospective students for UCLA, and a convincingly nightmarish thought for prospective Cal students given the horror stories that come out of CalDining.  Lastly, student mental health (and physical) will immediately improve.  You all know the feeling of having to eat CalDining.

Allison Mack of Smallville and NXIVM sex cult fame, who used women's sensitive personal information to blackmail them into sexual slavery, is now a student at Berkeley. She's a new transfer student which means she was admitted with all of the charges against her being public knowledge. She was in my ""Gender, Sex and Power"" class for about a week, but left voluntarily after outcry from students who did not feel safe discussing those topics with someone who branded other women. As far as I know she is still a student at Berkeley, but I don't know what other classes she is taking this semester. Our professor will not tell us how the administration is handling this matter being brought to their attention due to privacy laws. It is not widely public knowledge that she is a student here, but she is a public figure and I feel morally obligated to let other students know about her presence.

Here's a source for the charges, which she plead guilty to last year but is still awaiting sentencing on.

It has a lot more information and it\'s pretty convincing that Mack is definitely attending classes at Cal.

Allison Mack doesn\'t belong at Berkeley, and if she is enrolled then admissions has a lot to explain.\n\nPrevious Edit: Other than students (subreddit members) who have claimed that they\'ve seen Mack in class, I could not find a single news source or other reliable source claiming that she is enrolled at UC Berkeley. For instance, (the following is entirely speculation and I\'m only speculating to show how little we know about Mack and Berkeley) Mack didn\'t plea guilty until July 2019, and she wasn\'t arrested until April 2018-it is entirely possible that she was accepted to UCB before the full scope of her criminal activities were known (before 2018) and she had delayed enrollment because she was a ""busy actress"". In which case, UCB had did nothing wrong by accepting her application (because back then, Allison Mack was ""a famous actress interested in women empowerment"". Wow, writing that hypocritical statement fills me with disguist). \n\nYou could make similar groundless claims: that Allison Mack isn\'t even a student and was simply auditing a Berkeley class for some messed-up reason, that Allison Mack is indeed a student and has been attending Berkeley under the alias ""Fucking Angel"" to protect her identity, etc. In any case, there is just too little information and we can\'t make any assumptions about either Allison Mack or UC Berkeley\'s role in this until more news comes out.

Being a Black student at Berkeley has been fucking rough, let me tell you that. I'm a data science major from OC, and I've never lived in a Black community. I'm often the only Black student in my lectures, let alone my sections. Seeing the insane difference between colleges (+ their students here) and Berkeley is giving me hope. Just this week, UCI students ran over protesters in Visilia, CA (google it, I won't post the article with their names in case that breaks rules).

The vast difference is only widening. While this whole thing fucking blows, I'm so proud that this student body is using this moment to tackle anti-Blackness and donate despite being broke and in college.

Pls sign my petition to show Berkeley Bowl that I am deserving of a second chance, and a redemption story arc. [http://chng.it/4pFjptMw5g](http://chng.it/4pFjptMw5g) 

Please see below for the heartfelt letter I am planning on sending them:

\*\*\*

Dearest Berkeley Bowl,

Please accept my humble apology. I have come to grovel at your feet and beg forgiveness after my difficult year of excommunication from your abundant halls. I have sinned and am ashamed; caught red handed, you sent me away and now I can only shop at Whole Foods and Safeway in my deep shame.¬†

I was blinded by my greed for tasty fancy nut butters, and lost control. During my long and cold year in exile I have had much time to reflect in my sorrow and guilt. Please accept my confession, I beg for your consecration of my sins. I am ready to be purified and receive the gift of the Bowl. I would lick the seats of BART a thousand times just to step foot once more inside of you.¬†

I toss all night longing for your rows of overpriced salad bowls and mediocre vegan cheddars, the $1 banana bags I will never again touch. I cry myself to sleep yearning for my groceries to be bagged by a white dude in dreads, longing to stick my hands into the bulk bins once more.¬†

I have rehearsed many a sleepless night my reentry into your sacred halls. My hands are folded carefully unto themselves and my temptations are contained dutifully. I have slathered my body in holy precious nut butters to show that I have had my fill of these plunders. I have affixed small chastity belts on each of my sticky fingers to remind myself of my past hasty decisions. If I fail in my rehearsals, I find apt punishment for myself in the morning.

Trust me, I am now a practiced and reformed citizen, needing only you to say the word and I shall be healed.¬†

With great sincerity and reverence, forever yours,¬†

1. Send humanitarian donations to[ https://www.supportukraine.co/](https://www.supportukraine.co/). They will go to save the lives of Ukrainian civilians, and to resist the actions of a bloody dictator by supporting our army.
2. Reach out to our representatives. Demand them to stand for the closure of Ukrainian skies by NATO which causes the main threat to the Ukrainian military. Demand the complete rejection of Russian gas and oil. Every cent going to Russia through the purchase of oil contributes to the bloody tyranny of Putin and his cronies.
3. Support the Ukrainian community. Every person in the anti-war protests, every post in support of us shows that you stand on the side of everything good.
4. Do not share or read any disinformation from Russian ""media"".
5. Join us during the anti-war protests.

46,ol3tve,rewff,379.0,0.89,21,berkeley,"There seem to be so many weird dangerous and/or EECS majors (they are the same) on or near campus. Why the fuck do people want the college of engineering to keep existing, and why doesn‚Äôt the university do something about the coders on campus? It seems like every other day I get an alert reading that some asshole has become a millionaire or got funding that went on campus. This is bizarre for a college campus, yet I‚Äôm never surprised when I hear about billionaires that started from coding try to have dick measuring contests in space, typically in the evening on reddit. Okay, no government regulations, fine, whatever, but goddamn it do something about these fucking coders.

If you want the college of engineering to keep existing or coders entirely on campus, I encourage you to take a stroll near the McLaughlin Hall, or on the dorm rooms of Foothill around 2 am. Get totally offput by the crying, multi colored lines of nonsense, and weirdo mechanical keyboard sounds (get a mac loser) and I assure your opinion on the matter would change.

Backstory: I was walking on campus today and almost solicited by a man who had a laptop, who asked me to ‚Äúcheck out his billion dollar idea.‚Äù or else. Luckily, I could tell his python script was garbage and ran (I ran, his script did not run at all). I went to Tsu-Jae King Liu and she seemed so fucking lax about it. This needs to stop now. If anyone is interested I would absolutely love to protest the VC's offering any bullshit idea money around campus. If you‚Äôve made it this far, go bears.

TLDR: Need less EECS majors. Computers don‚Äôt belong on or near campus. If you‚Äôre down with the college of engineering, I hope your idea never gets funding. If you‚Äôre down with EECS majors and especially if you participate in their weird rituals of hogging Moffit hall, you can go brick your computer and lose all your work.

EDITüñï: I hope the EECS majors at McLaughlin Hall are removed and placed within mental health facilities where applicable and those of good mental standing are to be offered enrollment at a different campus, preferably stanturd. Berkeley bulletin boards look like shit. Then bulldoze the McLaughlin Hall and erect nothing there, those grounds are cursed and condemned. God The EECS defenders are so fucking autistic it makes my skin melt.

Some interesting takeaways:

1) SAT scores are a strong predictor of college GPA and retention rates, even after adjusting for high school GPA. For lower-income students, they are a much *better* predictor than high school GPA. [(source)](https://imgur.com/a/jcKVNoO)

2) A large portion of underrepresented students (just under a quarter of Latino students, 40% of black students, and 47% of native american students) were admitted to some UC campus because of their statewide eligibility due to their SAT score.

3) 

> It is important to note that this system works as well as it does because
UCOP receives both test scores and grades for all the applicants to any UC campus from a given high
school. Because UCOP receives scores from so many of the students at each school, they can supply the
campus admissions officers with **scores normalized by high school, thus letting the readers judge whether
a student performed exceptionally well in the local context.** A switch away from mandatory submission of
test scores to a ‚Äútest-optional‚Äù regime in which students choose whether or not to take a test/submit a
score would remove UCOP‚Äôs ability to normalize scores by school and thus to compensate for school to
school variability in educational quality. 

4) 

> UC does not use
hard score cutoffs. **UC admits members of different groups with widely varying test scores. It is well
known that students in disadvantaged groups tend, on average, to have lower HSGPAs and test scores
than students without such disadvantage.** The UC application asks students to report, among many other
things, their annual family income and whether they would be the first member of their immediate family
to graduate from a four-year institution (first-generation status). Table 3C-1 presents the differences in
average HSGPA and SAT for three groups: low-income vs. not low-income; first-generation vs. not firstgeneration; and applicants who are both low-income and first-generation vs. those who are neither. These
group average differences are substantial, especially for those applicants who are both low-income and
first-generation47.

In short, the UCs are perfectly capable of evaluating test scores in context. A poor, first-gen student will not be directly compared 1-to-1 to a rich suburban kid just because they took the same test. There is no evidence, at all, that getting rid of the SAT helps anyone. SAT scores are at least as useful as grades in determining student quality.

I am not allowed per policy to use a UC machine because of the type of data, and was informed that using a non-UC machine for this (which I am) would theoretically open me up to personal liability.  Not a threat, mind you, just information I should have.  As such I've already deleted my copy of the data, and will not be offering the service.
> 
> UCOP's excuse for not offering this service themselves is, well, unclear.  To paraphrase, I get excuses like ""Its an ongoing investigation"", ""The data is PII so we have to do it on air-gapped machines"" (never mind the risk of theft is negligible because it is already stolen data!), ""Just sign up for the Experian service"", ""There is so much data involved"" (cue laughter at the notion of 3 GB compressed being a lot of data), ""We don't want to spam people with notifications because it will just be ignored"" (well, that is true, they spam us with so much other stuff that hey, why is this more important?).
> 
> At this point, the ""ongoing investigation"" however is a smoke-screen and the rest of the excuses ring hollow as well:
> 
> We know the amount of data released, because it can be downloaded easily.
The UCOP also knows what data might have been stolen but is not included in the released data: The forensics examination of the compromised server was completed at least a month ago.  If the attacker did not succeed in fully deleting the logs they know the data the attacker accessed but did not include in the dump.  And if the attacker did delete the logs they should simply assume that all the data on it when it was compromised was released.
> 
> And the data itself is really in two forms: tabular data about lots of people and individual communications.  The tabular data is of the largest concern for most of us, since most of us don't actually need UCOP exceptions on the various HR processes.  This data doesn't just include social security # but potentially other sensitive information, such as self reported disability status, addresses, self reported sexual orientation, student IDs, etc.
> 
> It would be a straightforward software engineering effort for the UC to provide a service that would allow us, the victims, to request all table entries which concern us.  I know because I was able to code up a primitive version of the searching on a single desktop in a couple of hours with generating this report taking a few minutes per person (and I could easily have tweaked it to a few seconds by doing a bit of different parallelism), and this is one of those tasks that qualifies as ""obscenely parallel"": you want 10x the throughput?

***General Tips:***

* Big C, Indian Rock Park, fire trails are really fun and local trails
* Be nice to Berkeley natives and your houseless neighbors. Remember you're only there for 4 years.
* Your friend group is going to change a lot throughout your first year, don't get too hung up on it.
* Almost all classes and student org events are on Berkeley time (starts 10 minutes after posted start time)
* Go exploring. Don‚Äôt be one of those people who miss out on all the exciting things in the bay. Available public transportation options:
   * Learn the BART lines and AC transit stops
   * BayWheels has crazy good deals for unlimited student access ($5 for a year if you‚Äôre EOP)
   * Bus rides around the city are free. No one really takes campus busses because Berkeley City buses are already really good
   * Gig rental cars are a dub
* **Download Transit** on your phone for public transit
* Don‚Äôt talk about your SAT/AP scores you nerds
* Everyone plays league/valorant/smash
* **Follow Flyerstack on Instagram/ join app waitlist** to keep track of events going on in Berkeley and on campus
* Don‚Äôt step on the seal or it will be one of the reasons you won‚Äôt get a 4.0
* Don‚Äôt buy your books unless you ABSOLUTELY need to (like homework codes). Get them online. (i'm not going to condone piracy but...)
* Everyone says it, but seriously, don't be afraid to ask for help from your professors or GSI's
* Don't live your entire life on campus, go out and explore shit. you're an adult now.
* imposters syndrome is real, but you deserve your spot here. Especially transfers.

***Food:***

* **Download snackpass** for online ordering and deals, for free food use my referral code (ashyang)
* Asian ‚Äúghetto‚Äù is great for late night options, gourmet ‚Äúghetto‚Äù on northside  is fire
* Andronico‚Äôs Community market is just Safeway but more expensive
* Dining Halls Rank:
   * Clark Kerr: food is the best, prettiest seating/venue
   * Foothill: sick views of the whole bay and campanile, food is aggressively mediocre, close to science buildings, get a seat by the window, we‚Äôre ranking this higher because of the views
   * Crossroads: food selection has more variety than cafe 3, vibes are better. They offer late night but tbh it doesn‚Äôt deserve the hype, go somewhere else on/off Telegraph It‚Äôs only worth it if you have leftover swipes
   * Cafe 3- awful unless you‚Äôre vegan (known as vegan cafe), there is meat but less selections than Crossroads. Kind of reminds us of pre-school
* On Campus/Close to Campus Cafe Ranking:
   * Babette Cafe (inside BAMPFA)- best coffee
   * !951 Coffee Company- both MLK and Channing Way Locations, pretty large latte size for the price you pay, it‚Äôs a nonprofit cafe that supports refugee communities
   * SoDoI Coffee Tasting House- if it opens back up after COVID, bomb-ass matcha latte, cute and family owned and operated
   * Caffe Strada- good price for size of coffee, a lot of robberies do happen here, lot of study space/outdoor plugs (but be aware)
   * Cafe Milano- coffee is not as good, but tons of seating (upstairs), good location
   * Romeo‚Äôs Coffee- kind of a gimmick location, cheesy romantic vibes, not the best for studying
   * Rude Awakening- good for studying, very close to campus on northside, coffee is mediocre
   * Way Station Cafe- deep southside, beer garden in back is good for hanging out
   * Best on campus cafes are: Yali‚Äôs in Stanley Hall for early lectures on east of campus and Free Speech Movement Cafe best for late night studying and apple clouds pastries are bomb
* Cafe‚Äôs not in Southside but still walkable/good for studying
   * My Coffee Roastery: super cute, and great coffee, next door is Flora Arte (super cute nursery/decor shop)
   * Blue Bottle- kind of basic, not as good for studying, good coffee, a little pricey
   * Saigon Express: high ranking because of their iced Vietnamese coffee, super cheap banh mi, pay in cash
   * Victory Point Cafe- can pay extra for board games, vanilla latte is bomb, plenty of seating/outlets, a little far
   * Gold Leaf Cafe- seating isn‚Äôt open yet, cute but millennial vibe

1. Don‚Äôt go to frat parties, but if you do if the frat doesn‚Äôt say the five pillars of consent when you enter RED FLAG
2. It won‚Äôt be as fun as you think it will be unless you‚Äôre friends with everybody
3. Get a pair of shitty, comfortable sneakers that you won‚Äôt be sad if beer or mud gets on them.
4. Most people don‚Äôt super clean jungle juice containers (personally I just spray it down with a hose) and a vodka plandle won‚Äôt kill as much mildew as you think it will.
5. You will need a bid for all frat parties after week one.
6. Bring your CalID during week one and GBO to frat parties
7. If you're a potential new member for PHC sororities during primary recruitment, you are not allowed to go to frat parties throughout recruitment week.
8. Learn rage cage/beer pong rules
9. Follow house rules for rage cage/beer pong. Each house/apartment has their own rules.
10. Shitty, cheap vodka/tequila/fireball is only downable for at most 1 year
11. Cheapest plandles: vitali (safeway), the plandle of gin (safeway),  Vodka of the Gods (trader joe‚Äôs),
12. Most Frat parties will only have shitty beer (keystone/natural light/coors) don‚Äôt expect claws and trulys (just pre-game)
13. Don‚Äôt lose sight of your cup, just throw it away if you lose sight of it
14. Go with friends and always keep tabs on each other
15. Eat before you drink
16. Drink water and electrolytes after (pedialyte is the best for hangovers)
17. MCGC, club, student org, and sport parties  >>> IFC frat parties
18. If you go upstairs for alc or whatever during a frat party be careful or go in a group","[{'author': 'aromaticchicken', 'body': 'Damn.

62,piq5vs,ohyeehuh,375.0,0.97,55,berkeley,"I would like to preface by saying that being accepted here is no easy feat, and congratulations to all the new Golden bears! This is in no way a minimalization of the great efforts of those who have partaken to reach here and I am very happy you are here. Very excited for what Cal has to offer for you. Hoo-rah you shining beauties. 

BUT MY GOD, the freshman rudeness I have been encountering in my classes has been astronomical. I'm a junior and its exciting see the new eager faces to learn here at Cal. But my goodness, there is admittedly a LOT of you who come off as egotistical, pretentious & sometimes a little classist due to your new-found ""Cal Pride"".  I get it. Being at a great school, no more parents, learning the things you want to do, meet new interesting folks ‚Äî the college experience you always wanted. it's exciting! But man, PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD PLEASE understand that you may have done fantastic things to get here but there are THOUSANDS of others on campus who are sitting in the same spot as you are.

Witnessed a freshman rudely interrupting over and OVER in lecture to a professor who clearly is an expert in their field by making long, mansplained points and not raising their hand (P.S. Professor has a doctorate). Had another freshman peer loudly scoffed during an exercise when they found a shortcut; yet the concept needed to be fully explained in lab so others can understand the lesson as well. I had another freshman I met in the past brag to me, ""Yeah, um did YOU get a full ride here?"". 

These instances speak for themselves. Just because you got the concept before anyone else, a full ride, multiple acceptance letters, the most perfect GPA, whatever, DOES NOT MEAN you're superior to any of the other Cal students in any form. Please take into consideration of the journey of those around you, the professors who spend so much time with their work, and the utmost privilege it is to attend Cal. Not many can get in here. Some had less resources than you to get in. Some moved across oceans & learn entirely different things to be here. That says a lot about what it means to be here at Cal, but it is up to you to uphold of what it means to be A PART of Cal. 

I know ya'll are 16-18 yo, but I, and maybe others, are tired of seeing freshman being motivated out of self-servient interest without consideration for anything/anyone beyond themselves. All for the shining guise of ""Cal glory"". You may think you are a diamond in the rough, but yet, you're sitting in a gold mine of other priceless gems too. 

This is more of a humbling post. If the shoe doesn't fit, then it doesn't apply. There is also a majority of freshman who are amazing, friendly and so grateful to be here. For that, I am happy for you, my golden friends. Stay safe and have the fun you deserve. 

Safe to say I don't have much to say to most newly-admitted transfers. Like always, ya'll keep being cool, maintain the vibes and I say congratulations for your acceptance here, my more jaded & mature golden bears <3","[{'author': 'Ryvn-', 'body': 'true, but also a phase. it fades during their first midterm season... soon...', 'score': 234, 'created_utc': 1630895587.0}, {'author': 'None', 'body': ""There was a (presumably) Freshman walk up to our GSI during discussion (16a) and tell her how knowledgable he already was in linear algebra AND differential equations.

Anyway, they were wasted and started to call me a tr*nny and a f*ggot (I am a trans girl and was wearing a dress that was pretty revealing because I should get to wear what I want without getting harassed) from across the courtyard, and started walking towards me. I was also pretty high and unable to really physically defend myself. They touched and groped me and after a little finally my friend was able to come down from putnam and help me inside.

* One tried to get my car towed after a weekend trip because too many leaves were collecting underneath it
* I've had friends who've come over to hangout and parked their cars legally, but an entitled boomer would come outside and demand they move them because ""that's their spot""
* They beep their horns like crazy. I've lived in LA and NY and people didn't beep their horns as often as these people do.

It angers me that my peers can be this fucking selfish and willfully ignorant. They signed a contract when agreeing to live in dorms. They choose to go to campus. 

With 2 variations of covid that are both a lot more contagious than the original, now is the time the university needs to take this seriously and start enforcing their rules. If we actually want to go back to some in person in fall, we need to these students to stop acting like entitled brats.

I was recently admitted as EECS to both Cal and UC Berkeley so I am having a really tough time deciding. I really want to go to Cal due to the prestige but UC Berkeley is in such an undeniably good location right in the Bay Area I literally cant resist. Many of my closest friends are also CS but they are choosing UC Berkeley over Cal. 

But at the same time, I understand that Cal CS is much better, so it should be a no-brainer on where to go. I'm just worried that I'll attend Cal and regret not attending UC Berkeley with my friends instead, since I heard it's more fun there too with it being by San Francisco and San Jose. 

I know UC Berkeley is great...but I can't help but being drawn to go to Cal. 

Can anyone help me with this dilemma ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫

81,v9eh46,mathanon20,490.0,0.85,343,berkeley,"In light of recent discussions on the sub, I think it's a good time to discuss something that has been on my mind for years now. Here are a few sketches of my experiences at Berkeley over the last few years.

In my class this semester, a Chinese student was being extremely critical of the US, and after agreeing with him on many points, I finally had to say ""No country is perfect, neither the US nor China"". He responded by saying roughly that China is flawless, and US is evil. I responded by asking about the detainment and abuse of millions of muslim Uyghurs in China, to which he replies, these atrocities do not exist. Upon showing him photos and videos he said ""Ohhh you mean the education camps..."" explaining that they are for the good of the muslims in China, and that he supported this behavior.

During the protests in Hong Kong, I woke up one morning, strolled through Sproul, and saw some flyers posted on a Hong Kong dedicated memorial tack-board in the plaza. I read the flyers about the atrocities committed by the CCP, and a number of Chinese students approached me and tried to convince me this was all untrue. They proceeded to remove the thoughtful artwork and anything else that was ""untrue"" from the tack-board.

I printed some small relevant infographics of my own in response, and hung them about campus. They were all removed within the week, some replaced by pro CCP flyers, despite other political statements on other flyers remaining in tact for weeks in the same locations.

Why is there no consequence for students at Cal supporting genocide?

Why is there no respect for the memorials of friends and family detained or killed by the CCP?

Why doesn't the university take action to prevent CCP propaganda on campus?

How can we solve this problem?

Edit: It does not make sense to me that we have mandatory workshops on inclusion and diversity as students here, university wide or in classes, yet the university pays no mind when someone advocates for genocide. Is this not the ultimate form of exclusion and hatred? In general, we want to be inclusive as Americans and Cal students, but could it be our bane that we act in good faith, and include even those who hate our country?

For those who aren't sure why we are having this conversation, here's the recent video that led us here [A Hong Kong student at Cornell University got assaulted by a Mandarin-speaking student for posting up signs that say ""Free Hong Kong"" and ""Free Uyghurs"". The assault left a cut on his left hand.](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/v8qg7l/a_hong_kong_student_at_cornell_university_got/)

Here's the sort of thing that I witnessed and described above [https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/dddsj7/guy\_tears\_down\_hong\_kong\_humanitarian\_fliers/](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/dddsj7/guy_tears_down_hong_kong_humanitarian_fliers/)

Clarification:

1. I am not conflating Chinese students with supporters of CCP atrocities, it seems the majority of comments from both Chinese and presumably other students understand this.
2. In response to all of the ""read the constitution, you can't outlaw free speech"" posts: I never suggested speech be outlawed, nor has any comment that I have read.
3. I think the point is summed up nicely by u/czar_el below, who wrote ""It's the ""tolerance of intolerance"" dilemma.

86,wzk5su,leukea,358.0,0.92,57,berkeley,"I lost some faith in the moral fabric of berkeley students last night.

Some might remember: around midnight yesterday, near the durant food court, an incident occurred which brought several police cars and a crowd of about 100. From what I saw, a mentally ill man in the front seat of a car, stopped in the road by two police cars, was having some kind of psychotic break and was clearly unequipped to drive, especially with a woman and a baby in the backseat. In my opinion, police presence *was* appropriate given the lack of safety in the situation, but whether their actions were justifiable is debatable. For one thing, I heavily blame the escalation of the situation on the horde of Berkeley students gathering, recording, watching, and *laughing* at the situation. At first, I thought recording was okay in order to keep the police involved accountable, but I highly doubt that people had that intention, since this man's suffering was apparently amusing to them. I feel guilty for not speaking up and telling people to have some respect, but I'm not sure I would've had much of an effect since the crowd was pretty strong, or maybe I'm just a pussy. The police restrained the man, supposedly because he was not complying, as instead of following their orders, he presented clearly an incapacity to function normally, rocking back and forth in his chair and only repeating ""I'm scared, I'm scared, I'm scared, I'm scared, I'm scared..."". He said nothing else. I'm sure that if the crowd elevating the situation had acted appropriately, the police would have felt less pressured to resort to force, as they likely would have waited for the man to calm down, and dealt with the situation in a way that was less traumatic for the man. Instead, people laughed and recorded as he was pulled out of the car by five officers, forced onto the ground to be handcuffed, and restrained with a lot of pressure on the ground for a good ten minutes. Not to virtue signal but the situation honestly made me tear up, and I will never view privileged Berkeley fucks the same way again. Also, this might have cured my imposter syndrome lol.","[{'author': 'lukewarmskyrunner', 'body': 'Unfortunately being accepted to Berkeley isn‚Äôt an indicator for a good moral compass.

Using several [reputable](https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080813163857AARspHD) [s](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0133079)[o](https://www.uclahealth.org/urology/mens-clinic/penile-implants)[u](https://www.campusreform.org/?ID=5450)[r](https://sexinfo.soc.ucsb.edu/when-will-my-penis-start-grow)[c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwjEeI2SmiU)[e](https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=1006060217670)[s](https://twitter.com/UCDLoveLab/status/1129865683334905857), I have compiled an official ranking of the average penis size of students at each UC.

**9. Merced: 0.00 inches**

Here is the thing about Merced: it doesn't actually exist. Has anyone ever seen the Merced campus and returned to tell the tale? Sure, there are a couple of vans that skirt around the other UC campuses with ‚ÄùUniversity of California UCM‚Äù proudly slobbered on their sides, and the students at Merced have always vigorously defended the existence of their school, but I challenge any Merced student to give me directions to their school that doesn‚Äôt take a paragraph to write.

**8. Berkeley: 3.68 inches**

Berkeley would be much higher up the rankings, but unfortunately they‚Äôre seriously let down by the students in the computer science departments. It isn't that the CS and EECS students tend to have smaller pee-pees, because that is simply not true (CS kids are the chaddiest of chads). No, the real problem is that computer science students watch so much hentai that it‚Äôs impossible for them to get hard without having four different screens of anime tiddies bouncing up and down and a hentai body pillow sitting in their lap.

**7. Irvine: 3.69 inches**

I have a real problem with Irvine students. All the Irvine kids on tinder always brag about how nice their campus is, the length of their wee-wee‚Äôs, and how they did not actually get rejected by UCLA (they just chose to go to a better school). Unfortunately, it is all just a ploy to hide how small and insecure their dicks and egos are. However, the Irvine students certainly make the most of the phrase ‚Äúit‚Äôs not about size, but about how you use it,‚Äù considering they're the masters of compensating.

**6. Santa Cruz: 4.20 inches**

The thing about Santa Cruz students is that they do not actually care at all about any type of ranking. Instead of taking lots of Viagra, Santa Cruz kids simply put on their yellow hoodies, lie down somewhere on campus, stick a fat joint into their mouths, and slowly slide along the ground making deep and erotic sounds in order to arouse themselves. This ritual is necessary for the banana slugs to get hard, since the perpetual cloud of weed that hangs over the Santa Cruz campus keeps the students supple and flaccid.

**5. Davis: 4.96 inches**

If you ever wander around the Davis campus, you begin to realize that it really is a cow town: the students literally moo as they slowly meander through the school. At first I thought it was just a ritual similar to Santa Cruz‚Äôs, but the sad reality is that Davis kids are so bored that they're always drunk. The Davis students never seem to reach their maximum pee-pee potential due to their drunken state, but at least they have something to show for themselves.

**4. Riverside: 5.39 inches**

Riverside kids have a lot going for them: pretty intense wee-wee‚Äôs, nobody cares about what they do, and they're great at exclaiming ‚Äúrivaside, mothafucka.‚Äù Slightly above average is probably the best way to describe Riverside students, and they should be proud that, for the first time, they aren‚Äôt second-last on a list ranking the UC‚Äôs.

**3. San Diego: 6.33 inches**

Triton sounds a lot like Trojan, but fortunately for San Diego students they actually have something to show for themselves, unlike their pompous LA neighbors. Surfing is proven to increase pee-pee size by at least 10%. However, only half of the school actually surfs; the other half never leave their rooms, preferring to game or game or make fantasy YouTube videos titled ‚ÄúHow I got into UCLA.‚Äù

**2. Los Angeles: 6.66 inches**

LA kids talk a lot of smack about how they have the biggest wee-wee‚Äôs of all the UC‚Äôs. Every other day you see another LA student post a picture of their penis on twitter with the caption ‚Äúlongest dong in the west baby haha #yeet #skraa #letsgetit.‚Äù However, like most of their delusions regarding their ranking, the reality is that they always have, and always will be, second best (with Chico State taking the top spot).

**1. Santa Barbara: 6.969 inches**

That‚Äôs right, the chads and brads that pollute Santa Barbara have the largest pee-pee‚Äôs in the UC system. Every SB student has: crazy big muscles, surfs, huge throbbing dicks, and a brain the size of a pea-pea. They don‚Äôt have to brag because they have nothing to compensate for, which pushes them up to the top spot.

When it comes to ranking the colleges at Berkeley, the only thing anyone with over 40iq (which excludes all EECS students) cares about is which college‚Äôs representatives would win in a battle royale if they were all dropped in bumfuck nowhere (examples: Palo Alto or Los Angeles). 

**#6: Haas**

Let‚Äôs be honest with ourselves for a second: has anyone in Haas actually been outside before? True, many of them go glamping using the internship money they get for being water girls and boys at washed up Fortune 500‚Äôs, but other than snakes they‚Äôre terrified of all living things. Haas kids wouldn‚Äôt survive in the wild for two minutes without leeching off the others, but since they provide nothing of tangible value the other colleges would simply allow for the invisible hand to actually do it‚Äôs job (for once).  

**#5: College of Engineering**

The College of Engineering is filled with big-brained individuals who played with too many legos and not enough lincoln logs as children. Instead of building bows and arrows and searching for food, they would instead build a trebuchet in an attempt to yeet the other colleges without getting their hands dirty. However, the trebuchet would miss and destroy their shelter, since their calculator would be an abacus made of nuts and sticks. Eventually the CoE students would die of anime tiddy deprivation. 

**#4: College of Environmental Design**

College of Environmental Design students spend their day wondering how to build a house that looks like an upside down turnip, before walking back across camping while pondering the many architectural marvels of Evans. In the battle royale, they would focus on re-arranging different flower patches to make them perfectly symmetrical with the landscape, neglecting the many dangers that inhabit the natural world. They would eventually be run over by Pumbaa and his many piggy friends scattered throughout the battle arena. 

**#3: College of Chemistry**

Have you ever wondered how chemistry kids relax after grinding mechanisms for eight hours? They sneak up into their chem labs, whip out some Erlenmeyer flasks, mix meth and percocet to create a whole new ‚Äòexperience,‚Äô and then brag about how they have an entire atom named after them. In the battle royale, the CoC peeps would hide in the corner and attempt to create (air)Berkelium2, but all of their water would be consumed in the process, resulting in their imminent and not-high deaths. 

**#2: (rAuSsEr) College of Natural Resources**

The hippies that constitute most of CNR spend most of their time worshiping trees and herb. Throughout the battle, the CNR flower children would dance naked around an ancient *Carnegiea gigantea* while stuffing vegetables in their ears to ward away evil capitalist conversations, allowing the liberating smell of burning weed to dramatically enhance their ritual. Nature would protect the free spirits of CNR, allowing them to outlive the previously mentioned colleges before they would eventually overdose on shrooms. 

**#1. L&S**

L&S obviously emerges victorious in our little game of Fortnite. There are enough majors in L&S to fill every role in society: linguistic majors to talk to the animals, history majors to count tree rings, economic majors to steal money from banks and later hang, pre-med majors to grow eggplants and treat boo-boos, art majors to complain about the lack of jobs, media studies majors to vigorously tweet about the whole experience, and CS majors to play pokemon on their gameboy using their chin while rubbing their areola with one hand and using the other to stick several fingers up their bum. L&S would survive and thrive in the wilderness, before the social sciences would rise up and overthrow their society in true Berkeley style. 

So there you have it freshman. If you‚Äôre cool, you‚Äôll go to L&S.

As a result, part of Sather Gate, our campus landmark, now bears burn marks.

[As seen on Wednesday](https://preview.redd.it/kxn4bsajfd3a1.jpg?width=1134&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=cc1fea1f25efe38b59cd0e352ead7b334f4dbeee)

The altar was placed there after a vigil was held on Monday night at Sather for the at least 10 victims who died in a fire in √úr√ºmqi, Xinjiang, on November 24. Their death is the latest result of China‚Äôs extreme ‚Äúzero covid‚Äù restriction, which bans people in certain areas from leaving their homes and buildings for months, and in many cases, authorities would even nail residential doors shut to physically bar people from going out.

So far, Chinese Communist Party‚Äôs (CCP) ‚Äúzero covid‚Äù lockdown has deprived people of basic food access, denied escape routes from buildings when an earthquake affected a major city, turned non covid patients away from hospital care and led to their deaths, quarantined elderlies and disabled people in unsafe and unsanitary conditions, displaced migrant workers, and caused a bus accident which killed more than two dozens. In the case of the fire, firefighters were delayed for more than half an hour by lockdown roadblocks, and fire escapes inside the building were blocked. The victims either burned to their death or died by jumping out the windows of their burning apartments. Instead of launching an investigation or rethinking their extreme lockdown measures, officials blamed the residents for ‚Äúhaving insufficient ability to save themselves‚Äù and quickly censored relevant contents online. This incident has sparked rare protests and memorial vigils in major cities in China, not only demanding an end to the ‚Äúzero covid‚Äù policy, but also asking for systemic reform and democratic freedoms. Their demands are now being met with arrests and police crackdown within China, so Chinese students across U.S. campuses, including here in Berkeley, have in turn held memorial vigils for the √úr√ºmqi fire victims and to stand with their fellow citizens in China.

However, it has come to our attention on Tuesday night, that an exchange student from China who is in support of the CCP regime took to a group chat to brag about having set fire to the memorial alter and to Sather Gate, calling it a ‚Äúpurification‚Äù of anti-CCP items. That message was sent at around 11:30pm on Tuesday night, and according to photos taken by fellow students, the burned marks on Sather Gate were already there by 10:30pm on the same night, and were also there to be found when we went to fact check this on Wednesday. Sather Gate was a gift to our campus more than a hundred years ago from Jane Sather, who was one of the earliest benefactors to UC Berkeley. The Gate is also a California Historical Landmark and listed in the National Register of Historic Places.

As the birthplace of the Free Speech Movement, you are entitled to have and express opinions on campus, in ways that do not involve violence or recklessly setting fire to a historical landmark. This individual had not only sided with the totalitarian CCP regime to oppress his fellow citizens and disrespected the memory of the fire victims, he also doesn‚Äôt seem to understand the consequences of arson or respect school property. We suggest that this individual come forward and apologize to the school and the student community for setting fire to our collective campus landmark, and to make necessary amends.

This is also a call for fellow Berkeley students to show compassion for each other‚Äôs suffering and defend our community against this type of behavior. The family and friends of many international students who come from Chinese territories, including my own, are suffering from the extreme lockdown restrictions I have described above. There will be more future campus vigils and protests associated with what is taking place in China, so if you see us, please show your support when you have a minute to spare. Thank you!

**Edit:**

**The moderator has requested that I remove all mention of this student‚Äôs name for this post to stay up, so if you‚Äôre new here, that is why his name is no longer mentioned. I am very grateful for the attention this has gotten, the very moved by support you all have shown in light of the tragedies and acts of courage taking place in China now. I must clarify that the intention is not for this to become a witch hunt to take this individual down, but for his actions to become an educational opportunity to raise awareness, because hunting down one inconsequential individual achieves very little. When Chinese/Hongkonger/Uyghur/Tibetan/Taiwanese student activists discuss politics on campus, the hostility we face mostly comes from those who look like us, speak our language, or hold the same passports as we do.

**Statement to Condemn Recent Incidents Violating Free Speech at American Institutions** 

Students for Hong Kong, alongside the below signatories, condemns the recent assault experienced by a Hongkonger student who recently graduated from Cornell University, as well as the destruction of the Tiananmen Memorial at UC San Diego on June 4th.

Around 6:30 PM ET on June 8th, 2022, in Ithaca, New York, a Hongkonger recent graduate from Cornell was physically assaulted in the Ithaca Commons. He was putting up posters to raise awareness about human rights abuses experienced by Hong Kongers and Uyghurs. A man wearing a ‚ÄúCal‚Äù hoodie confronted, and threatened him in Mandarin. When the victim took out his phone and tried to record the assault, the assailant pushed him to the floor and attempted to snatch his phone, leaving a wound on his left hand. The perpetrator only released him when a bystander intervened, but then continued to tear down more posters.

This was a clear attempt to silence someone speaking up for human rights through intimidation and physical violence. The perpetrator‚Äôs assault not only violated the law, but also the rights and dignity of the victim, in particular the victim‚Äôs freedom of expression.

Unfortunately, this is not an isolated incident. Hongkonger and Chinese students‚Äô freedom of expression are being suppressed at American universities by force in recent years. 

Since 2019, many more incidents have arisen. Last year, participants were harassed at UC Davis‚Äô ‚ÄúStand With Hong Kong‚Äù rally on October 1st last year. Just a few days ago at UC San Diego, the ‚Äú8964‚Äù Tiananmen Massacre Memorial installation was vandalized and destroyed. More examples can be found on the infographic that Students For Hong Kong has put together. 

All of these incidents show a serious pattern of harassment and intimidation towards students who criticize the Chinese government‚Äôs various human rights violations, and the result is a chilling effect on students‚Äô willingness to speak up about human rights, despite ostensibly enjoying a constitutional right to freedom of speech.

Support from those in positions of power is essential to fighting this kind of intimidation. For instance, in 2019 the Associated Students of UC Davis passed a resolution titled ‚ÄúDavis For Hong Kong‚Äù that condemned the intimidation and harassment faced by Hong Kong student groups at UC Davis.  

We should be free of fear when speaking up on university campuses, and especially so in the United States, where freedom of speech is considered a basic civil right and social value, and is also enshrined in the US Constitution.

In solidarity with our fellow peers, we urge our allies, as well as students and administrators at Cornell University, UC San Diego, UC Berkeley, the University of California system, the University of California Student Association, and all student governments to condemn such intimidation, assault, and harassment. Tertiary education institutions that promote equality and diversity should ensure that the rights of students, particularly marginalized students, are protected.

In the unfortunate yet likely case that more and more instances of violence, harassment, and intimidation against Hongkonger students and our allies will continue to happen, we strongly urge everyone to pay close attention, stand up for students who are being oppressed, and speak up against these incidents.

Over the years I've written a couple of long comments on posts here from people who find themselves struggling part-way though the semester. People seemed to think they were pretty helpful, so I thought I would try to give you all a leg-up and frontload the advice now.

For context, I did my undergrad at Berkeley in engineering and I'm finishing up a PhD at Cal. I have been a TA and a GSI and have seen courses from the ""other side.""

Obviously a lot of this may have to be adjusted to adapt to the hybrid system we're using right now due to COVID-19, but the main themes still apply.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Getting straight A's is not as hard as people say once you learn ""the system"". Most of the 4.0 students I knew used the system. I was a solid B/B- student for two years until I figured it out the system myself and then I had a 4.0 every semester after that.

One caveat first, this advice is for students in engineering, math, and the sciences. I don't know how relevant this advice will be for students in the liberal arts.

Here's the system:

1. **Never skip lecture.**  Even if you think they're not helpful, boring, or whatever, you still must go. It is way easier to stay up to speed on assignments and exam material if you're actually going to class. Professors tend to drop *huge hints* that aren't in the course notes or books.
2. **Do whatever you need to be mentally present in lecture.** It's really important to be mentally present during class. Turn your phone off and physically separate it by giving it to a friend during class if you have to.
3. **Do not skip discussion sections, but bail on bad GSIs.**  Again, be mentally present there. Put your phone away. Take really good notes in section because this is where they present tips that will be on the exam. If your GSI is bad at teaching or you can't understand them, find another section if possible. Give yourself every reason to stay mentally present.
4. **Actually do the readings before class.**  You don't have to ""read read"" it, but you must know ahead of time the core concepts that will be covered in lecture. The second/third time you see something is usually when it ""clicks"" and it is way better for your grades if that happens while you're seeing the material how your professor presents it.
5. **Treat unfinished assignments like you're playing Russian roulette.**  Unfinished assignments should make you very uncomfortable. Every day you postpone finishing a homework is like adding a bullet to the gun. Sure, you might be able to finish it the night before, but what if something unplanned comes up? That cute guy/girl in your class wants to get boba but you have a homework due tonight at midnight? Now you have a tough decision that leaves you feeling bad the next day either way you choose.
6. **If you are struggling with a problem on an assignment or practice exam, move on and revisit in office hours.**  Math and physics majors may tell you otherwise, but in my experience there is actually very little to gain in terms of learning by hitting your head against the wall. Get in front of the professor or GSI at the earliest available opportunity (office hours or discussion) explain your difficulty and what you have tried so far, and then ask them to help get you unstuck. If you're following  *Rule 5*  you should have no problem finding a time to talk to them before the due date.
7. **If you are doing Rules 1-6, you probably don't have to study much for exams.** This was the most surprising thing to me. **""Studying"" is the biggest scam in college that wastes your time**. Being in a library reading will not magically make your grades better. Instead, what you should be doing is ""practicing."" If you have been keeping up with the class properly, then you probably just need to do a practice exam or two before the real thing and you'll very likely get an A. Review solutions only after you have finished completely and go back through the solutions to problems you missed and think about whether there are any strategies in those problems that you could add your arsenal. Once I started following the system. I would spend maybe 3 hours reviewing before midterms and finals and still ace them after I was on the system.
8. (Bonus)  **Ask your GSI/professor to help you understand why you got exam/homework problems wrong.**  This is a really nice way to discover holes in your knowledge or any misunderstandings you have about concepts. This is the stuff that kills you on the final exam, and reviewing missed points on assignments and exams with experts on the material is the most time-efficient ways to stitch up those holes.

**At Berkeley you will learn that ""working the hardest you have ever worked in your life"" will still not be enough to succeed.** You have to work *better* than you have ever worked in your life in order to achieve true success in this world.

**Success = Effort x Effectiveness**

Becoming really effective means taking on a growth mindset and actually putting in consistent efforts to strengthen your weak spots. The system I presented above is really good at helping you find and address those weak spots.

Finally, I want to address mental health issues. This system is not incompatible with learning disabilities and/or depression. I know this because I was diagnosed with dysgraphia, ADHD, and depression and implemented the system in my life while dealing with all three at Berkeley. Everyone draws a unique hand in life and it's up to you to figure out the best way to play it.

However, no matter who you are, Berkeley is naturally going to be  *stressful.* I think college is stressful for just about anyone at any institution. Stress does all sorts of weird things to people's mental state, so if you're not proactive about it you can succumb to apathy and depression pretty easily. Instead of being reactive to the challenges that school throws at you, you have to be proactive and make sure you are keeping your brain healthy so it can resist self-destructive behaviors. Here's my advice to kill the stress and succeed in a difficult undergrad institution:

1. **Make getting 7+ hours of sleep every night your #1 priority**. I know this sounds like an impractical thing to make your #1 priority, but sleep is the absolute top thing that allows your brain to resist stress. If you can achieve solid sleep you will be 2-3x more productive during the day and actually spend  *less*  time working to get the same results in your classes. Even when you have something due the next day you must follow this rule because otherwise you will consistently not get enough sleep and procrastinate your work up until the last minute. It's a deadly cycle that will destroy your productivity and mental health and put you right back in this position.
2. **Eat at least 3 (healthy) meals per day at reasonably spaced intervals and drink lots of water.**  Your brain needs the proper nutrition and hydration to function. If you're skipping meals because you're late to class, you're sabotaging your brain's ability to function properly.
3. **""Relaxation time"" must actually be relaxing.**  Watching tv/movies or using social media is actually very mentally exhausting without us realizing it. Visual entertainment is extremely stimulating for our brains (which is why we get the ""*gooood chemicals*"" when we watch it.) If you need to relax after a long day of class, go to the gym, do yoga, meditate, draw a picture, or go for a walk instead of watching Netflix. You'll be amazed what 15 minutes of mindfulness can do for your ability to get a lot done afterwards.
4. **As soon as a reading/assignment is assigned, work your butt off to get it to 80% and then put it down.**  This is the key to getting straight A's at Berkeley. You have to give yourself enough time to mentally ""chew"" on material and seek out help in office hours, which is absolutely impossible if you're rushing to finish it before a deadline. Following the  [Pareto Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle), getting 80% of an assignment done should only take 20% of the total time. Skim through the reading/notes before class to get to a retention level of about 80% of what you would get in a real reading of the material (this means you understand the main points and can write a rough outline of what is discussed). In class you'll get the other 20% filled in for you or at least have an idea of what sections to go re-read. On homework, if you get stuck on something, put it aside and work on the next part of the assignment until you have about 80% done. Then go to office hours and ask for clarification/hints on the parts that didn't come quickly to you. You will find the material in your classes much more interesting and motivating if you work this way.
5. **Never, ever skip class unless you really can't help it.**  This is the other thing that truly unlocks straight A's. Stress largely originates from uncertainty and the fear that comes with it. ""What will be on the exam? What if I didn't study that thing? What if I fail the exam? What if I don't get a good internship because I have a bad grade?..."" The easiest way to combat this is to just go to class and be mentally present. Professors will tell you exactly what they expect you to know in class and lectures push you to think in ways you would not alone. There's a reason that university lectures did not go extinct after books were invented. Trying to catch up after just one day of missed class is a killer headwind to overcome so do everything in your power to avoid giving yourself that handicap. It really kills motivation to go to the next class if you missed the previous one.

The key to college is doing less work but doing it consistently as opposed to chaotically scrambling from one task to the next while taking liberties with things that help you maintain mental health. Optimizing for short-term gains over long-term gains is what gets students sub-optimal results.","[{'author': 'None', 'body': ""As a former engineering student and grad student, this is important advice not only for Berkeley but for any school.

The point here isn't that the average student will do well on an absolute scale.

We spend so long and so hard trying to get awesome grades, trying to get into competitive clubs, trying to get into honor societies, and whatnot. Then, in the end, it's over--you graduate and move on. That C in Data 8 suddenly doesn't bother you anymore. Or that shitty presentation you gave just doesn't matter.

&#x200B;

You know in Lord of the Rings when Sam throws the ring into that lava, and Frodo is like....it's over. It's done. That's how I feel rn.

&#x200B;

It's over. It's done. All of the stress relating to school, nerves about presentations, or getting random points off or shitty ass profs. It's over. It's done. 

&#x200B;

So some parting thoughts:

* Don't take Armero for CE 30. Just don't
* How come the women professors, in my experience, are just a lot nicer, kinder, and better at explaining shit than the male professors??
* Just try your best in school. Whatever grade you get--you get. Don't stress about getting all A's or B's. I got some C's and I'm still here :) 
* GSI office hours are literally the best.
* Concrete doesn't smell good and most definitely does not taste good. Don't eat concrete, no matter how appetizing.
* Get 7-8 hours of sleep a night. I mean it
* This school is so goddamn expensive and why did my shitty-ass apartment cost so much?????
* Alcohol still does not taste good. Will only consume if I wish to get fucked up.

Summary: there were two unhoused people still there and two protesters were arrested. 

I think it's necessary to build on People's park for the housing and that the fact that it is unacceptable to have an epicenter of crime right in the middle of current and future student housing. 

Also protesters have to realize it's Cal's property and it has done more for the homeless than the city or the state. Cal has given up student housing space for a homeless housing addition, sponsored another project for those being displaced, and sponsored a day time center that was recently constructed (and being heavily used daily).  All by a UNIVERSITY.","[{'author': 'None', 'body': ""It's about time.

DM me what time you're available over the next few days and what your questions are about and maybe I'll be free to help (best effort on my part for scheduling). I'm not going to help you with projects because I would have to read the whole spec and get up to speed on what you've already done which is annoying (Also it's sort of cheating).

# The 21 Essential Things To Do

* **Go thrifting at Urban Ore** *This place has more doors than Monsters Inc. It has even more toilets than it has doors, and all of those toilets are terrible, but checking them out is always the highlight of my visit. There‚Äôs a cat that hangs out among the bins full of paintings. Beware of Urban Ore if you have a rust-related phobia.*
* **Trespass on the Pier at the Berkeley Marina** *Actually, don‚Äôt do that. While I‚Äôve visited many times, I‚Äôve yet to jump the fence. The pier was originally built as a ferry dock to San Francisco, and on Big Game days traffic would be backed all the way up University as a result. The pier itself is massively long (originally 3.5 miles) and stretches towards Alcatraz. It‚Äôs mostly rotting now, but I think that the city council is considering rebuilding it, so fingers crossed that we‚Äôll be able to set foot on it someday. In terms of things that you can appreciate more legally, consider throwing a barbecue or visiting the turkeys. On the way out you‚Äôll notice how terrible the road is. My Uber driver once told me that this is because so many people would drag race up and down that they just stopped repairing it, and now driving it is an awful experience for everyone.*
* **Eat Tacos While Watching a Rose Garden Sunset** *This one feels pretty basic, but it‚Äôs remarkable how many people I know who haven‚Äôt ever given it a visit. One of Berkeley‚Äôs best civic installations, I think. Roses bloom between March and graduation, so get out there!!!*
* **Smell at corpse flower at the** [**Botanical Gardens**](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/08/10/outdoors-6-hidden-gems-to-explore-at-berkeleys-uc-botanical-garden/?utm_email=34FD247564A7C51334A8C5E2AC&g2i_eui=6RGiZLQu26%2b7Ly8ImNGZHaWcBJW7A3VR&g2i_source=newsletter&utm_source=listrak&utm_medium=email&utm_term=https%3a%2f%2fwww.mercurynews.com%2f2020%2f08%2f10%2foutdoors-6-hidden-gems-to-explore-at-berkeleys-uc-botanical-garden%2f&utm_campaign=bang-mult-nl-morning-report-nl&utm_content=manual) *Depressingly few Berkeley students take advantage of the fact that admission is free for them. You probably won‚Äôt be able to see the corpse flower since it only blooms every seven years (though you can see the plant in its non-flowering state--the entire thing is just one leaf that looks like a tree), but you‚Äôll still be able to appreciate the Chinese Medicinal Herb Garden and the extremely specific ailments that each plant soothes. Pretend to get married under the trellis in the Garden of Old Roses. Resist the temptation to steal a vegetable from the edible garden. Buy me a succulent at the garden store (or look for the pencils I designed that are carried there!) Read Paradise Lost on a bench at the top overlooking all of Berkeley. Look for salamanders in the Japanese pond. Find the petrified tree log. Appreciate how well-kept the Bamboo Path is. And if you find pineapple sage, please bring me some.*
* **Save Hundreds While Shopping for Spices in the Sari District** *I don‚Äôt think that anybody calls it the Sari District beyond me and my friends. If you‚Äôve ever taken the 51B down University though, you‚Äôll probably have noticed that there are like three sari stores and three Indian grocery stores all clustered together. There is no better place to buy spices in all of Berkeley. If shopping is a social experience for you, as it is for me, it can be fun spending 30 minutes appreciating the massive selection that these stores offer, and if you plan on celebrating Diwali, also pick up some rangoli powder and candles!*
* **Spend a day in Tilden** *That there are some fantastic hikes up here is a given--I‚Äôll let you find those on your own. There are several other things to try out up here though:*

>‚Ä¢ Walk the rim of Lake Anza  
>  
>‚Ä¢ Hunt for mushrooms  
>  
>‚Ä¢ Visit the Little Farm (it‚Äôs a petting zoo I think?)  
>  
>‚Ä¢ Ride the Carousel

* **Find the Weirdest Artifact in Elmwood**  *There are some strange stores up here. Foremost is Tail of the Yak, David Sedaris‚Äô favorite shop in Berkeley, which has several live birds in cages. There‚Äôs also a very cool Ohlone art gallery, some famous bookstores, and usually way too many kids. While you‚Äôre here, grab a chocolate sample from Casa de Chocolates and find the weirdest ice cream flavor at Humphrey Slocombe (my favorite so far is candy cap mushroom brownie). Also check out the indie comic book store and Star Grocery on Claremont Avenue.*
* **Fly a kite at Caesar Chavez Park**
* **Allow a Monitor Lizard to Inspect your Soul at the East Bay Vivarium** *And while you‚Äôre there, explore 4th street.*
* **Try a new Fruit at Berkeley Bowl** *I love their pomelos. Quinces boiled in sugar and cinnamon are also excellent, and, if you haven‚Äôt ever tried cactus fruit, consider a prickly pear. Or a buddha‚Äôs hand. Don‚Äôt get cherimoya fruit though‚ÄîI accidentally dropped $11 on a single one the other week, not realizing exactly what I was getting into. I exchanged it for a bag of roasted peanuts and an $8 return. They also have an impressive selection of roots that I can‚Äôt even begin to appreciate (though I did once try their Taiwanese burdock just because it was so absurdly long), and their quick-sell rack has produce for less than $1. If it‚Äôs the right time of year you can also find Turkish delight.*
* **Contemplate the Economics of** [***BioFuel Oasis***](https://biofueloasis.com/) *One of the Bay Area‚Äôs fabled biodiesel stations, located on Ashby west of campus. My professor had a story about a guy who would drive here all the way from Menlo Park, and use up half of the gas he bought each time just driving there and back.*
* **Crash an End-of-Year Barbecue at Bowles** *I don‚Äôt think their parties are exclusive? I‚Äôve never asked. It‚Äôs a tradition though, and they‚Äôd probably be happy to have you.*
* **Or even better: Attend Dinner at Cloyne Court. Sign Your Soul Over to the BSC. And Then Escape.** *Green Day, No Doubt, and Elliott Smith all played here, back when the punk scene in Berkeley was alive and well, and back when Cloyne wasn‚Äôt substance-free. This repurposed hotel, which I have written about many times before, was designed by John Galen Howard (the guy who designed the Campanile and many other buildings on campus--note the resemblance to North Gate Hall!) and named for Cloyne, Ireland, the town from which Bishop George Berkeley (!!!) hailed. They have a sauna and ghost stories and some of the strangest culture you‚Äôll find anywhere in Berkeley. Read literally anything that I wrote in* [*Spring 2020*](https://elbow99.substack.com/p/now-that-we-live-in-a-co-op-we-cant) *because there‚Äôs no way I can even begin to scratch the history of the building here.*
* **Witness 4/20 on Memorial Glade** *Whatever your relationship with weed, it‚Äôs a sight to behold. I was on Bechtel Terrace, attending English 165, on 4/20/20 at 4:20. I observed that a national pandemic didn‚Äôt stop them. The year prior, Cal Day would have fallen on 4/20, but there was no way they‚Äôd let parents onto campus that day so they changed it back to 4/13.*
* **Peruse the film archive at the BAMPFA** *This is another opportunity that woefully few students take advantage of. They have both rotating and stationary exhibits, and at the start of each school year they give out free pizza and posters. Visiting the library is fun regardless of how much you know about film (for instance, who isn‚Äôt interested in at least the \*idea\* of Soviet animation), and you can also go to artsy film screenings put on by the BAMPFA student committee.*
* **Watch the moon rise over the Berkeley Hills** *Sunrises are overrated, and our view is blocked by the hills anyway. Moonrises are, in my opinion, just as beautiful, though they‚Äôre much more difficult to catch because the moon 1) goes through phrases and 2) rises an hour later each night, so it takes a lot of planning to catch it. On the right night, the tendrils of clouds in the hills will appear to catch fire, and it‚Äôs surreal to see an orb appear to melt in reverse, warped by the shape of the hills. To catch the moon rising, look up the day‚Äôs moonrise, and expect to see it rise above IHouse. When you‚Äôre further from the hills, it will appear to rise sooner (because the hills will be comparatively closer to the horizon)--at the Berkeley Marina for instance, a 7:22 moonrise might actually occur around 7:30. If you‚Äôre trying to catch it across from Kroeber, expect to have to wait 40 more minutes.*
* **Buy something you didn‚Äôt need at the Berkeley Flea Market, or any one of the farmer‚Äôs markets** *You‚Äôve probably stumbled into one of these by accident at least once. There‚Äôs a craft fair on Telegraph most weekends in December, a permanent flea market on Ashby each Saturday, and three farmers markets scattered across Berkeley throughout the week. At the very least, try some cheese samples.*
* **Spend a memorable Halloween or Valentine‚Äôs Day participating in the Rocky Horror Picture Show at the UC Theater** *If you‚Äôre looking for a more mellow event, go to a concert at Cornerstone. I saw Summer Salt, Motel Radio, and Kid Bloom for $15 total. This is one of my favorite Berkeley venues.*
* **Befriend a cat a Sleepy Cat Books** *They only want to be your friend. The owner is also really nice. And look for the rest of Berkeley‚Äôs indie bookstores:*

>‚Ä¢ Revolution Books *You might have seen their iconic corner signs on Telegraph. Here, the counterculture is alive and well.*  
>  
>‚Ä¢ Moe‚Äôs  *If you‚Äôre looking for other locations featured in The Graduate, there‚Äôs also Sproul, Theta Delta Chi, and that boarding house on Dana and Channing*  
>  
>‚Ä¢ Pegasus  
>  
>‚Ä¢ Mrs. Dalloway‚Äôs  
>  
>‚Ä¢ Half-Price Books  
>  
>‚Ä¢ Eastwind Books

* **Stop into a store you‚Äôve never visited on Shattuck or Telegraph** *At the least, every Berkeley resident should be able to say they‚Äôve set foot inside of Amoeba or Games of Berkeley. J-town is good for snacks. If you‚Äôre closer to Northside, Victory Point Cafe is an acceptable substitution.*

# Weird Berkeley History and Rabbit Holes To Explore & Visit

Because of the nature of rabbit holes, I‚Äôm going to keep this section light so that you can discover each story for yourself.

* **What Was Formerly Barrington Hall** *Okay the stories about this place are WILD. Barrington (located near the Academy of Psychic Studies) used to be one of the houses in the Berkeley Student Cooperative. Steve Wozniak was a resident. Among other things, it was significant to the Berkeley punk rock scene, and maybe the heart of Berkeley counter culture itself. The cooperative was notorious for its non-stop partying and general lack of personal accountability (it was hard to say who was and wasn‚Äôt a resident) and eventually was shut down. There are stories of a python that escaped in the house, the ‚ÄúHell Summer‚Äù that ensued when the BSC tried to crack down on the cooperative, and it birthed my favorite quote, ‚Äúthe poetry reading is out of control,‚Äù uttered by a police officer as Barrington residents took their last stand against eviction.* [*Here‚Äôs*](https://ejinjue.org/green-book/countercultures-last-stand/#what-were-the-problems) *where I‚Äôd begin, though as with all good research, the real facts are in the footnotes. Also be sure to read the* [*response*](https://ejinjue.org/green-book/responses/fall-of-barrington-hall/)*. It‚Äôs hard to say how things really were, since Barrington is often used as a scapegoat for counter-culture itself, but we can be certain that it was a wild ride. Some of its legacy lives on in Casa Zimbabwe (and for a while, in Cloyne, although since the university owns the building they were able to crack down on the drug culture and it‚Äôs now substance and punk rock-free) and at 924 Gilman.*
* **2603 Benvenue #4, or, more famously, the apartment from which Patty Hearst was kidnapped by the Symbionese Liberation Army** *This is a private residence, so if you visit please just glance at it before moving on. I make an annual pilgrimage here while listening to American Heiress by Jeffrey Toobin. I think a lot of my generation is unfamiliar with the story (I only came across it while listening to an interview with Terry Gross), but it was one of the most high-profile kidnappings in California history. To begin, I recommend the aforementioned book--it‚Äôs good audio for walking around Berkeley, though I think that Tobin held a certain amount of disdain for his subject--or even just Wikipedia. There‚Äôs a lot to dig into.*
* **Unabomber‚Äôs Cottage (2628-A Regent Street)** *He only taught here for two uneventful years, but somehow he‚Äôs inextricable from the Berkeley Identity. You can find your own way to this rabbit hole. While you can‚Äôt walk up to the cottage itself, you can catch a glimpse of it behind a gate. I‚Äôm unsure of whether they ever let strangers visit.*
* **Or if you‚Äôre looking for something wholesome, this Cal student‚Äôs** [**blog**](https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~eldrin/index.html) **from 1999** *This is truly a gem. This student wrote about his insecurities and friendships candidly. As a student who also writes, it‚Äôs so fun and strange to see many of my own thoughts written out two decades before I ever thought them. His photos are also excellent--there are a few shots of parts of campus that don‚Äôt exist anymore. Aashna and I did some sleuthing and found his LinkedIn profile today, and it seems that he‚Äôs accomplished all of his dreams and more. In a time of uncertainty--both in my life and in my country‚Äôs history--it really meant a lot that I was able to read his story and see that things turned out alright for him.*

# Trips By Bus

* El Cerrito--Sunset View Mortuary  *Find the oldest headstone. Spend 20 minutes at the Mausoleum at the top of the hill--inside it‚Äôs spacious and light-filled--and see how much you can learn about local history just by reading the names and symbols that appear on the memorial plaques. On Sundays they give sermons, and it‚Äôs haunting to hear the words echoing through the halls. You don‚Äôt need to listen closely.*
* Oakland‚ÄîMountain View Cemetery *This was designed by Frederick Law Olmstead--the same guy responsible for Central Park and, unfortunately, the Stanford University campus. Ghirardelli was buried here! Unfortunately the Cemetery itself is closed to the public, and I have some‚Ä¶ mixed feelings about that, but the Mausoleum is open and it‚Äôs worth the trip. It‚Äôs a Julia Morgan building (she was buried behind it, and so was Bernard Maybeck) and I can‚Äôt believe that some of the rooms are indoors--they‚Äôre filled with plants and mosaics and water installations. It‚Äôs gothic, but it‚Äôs also uniquely Californian.*
* Albany‚ÄîAlbany Bulb *This is one of my favorite trips I‚Äôve ever taken--I‚Äôve been thrice now. This former landfill was home to an art community for several decades. You can still go visit their installations if you‚Äôre willing to do a little bit of exploration. There‚Äôs a labyrinth, dragons made of driftwood, and giant sculptures made of twisted metal. It‚Äôs a quiet place. Definitely read up on its* [*history*](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/albany-bulb) *before you go.*
* Albany‚ÄîTEPCO Beach *This Albany beach is littered with porcelain. It was the former dumping ground for a ceramics company. When I went I was only able to find four different colors of porcelain (the periwinkle is beautiful), not including algae-stained shards and sea glass, but maybe you can do better? The shards with the Tepco logo printed on them are highly collectible.*
* Oakland‚ÄîLake Merritt  *Surrounded by interesting things on all sides. There‚Äôs a bonsai garden, tropical garden, community garden, and creepy Children‚Äôs Playland.*
* Oakland‚Äî[Phap Duyen Tu](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/phap-duyen-tu-buddha-shrine-of-oakland) *This place has one of the most interesting origins of any of the sites I‚Äôm mentioning here. Some guy was tired of neighbors dumping trash on his cul de sac, so he put out a statue of Buddha hoping it would commend some respect for his corner. While he himself was non-religious, the local Buddhist community adopted the statue and gradually began building a shrine around it. What started out as weekly offerings slowly became more elaborate, and today the shrine draws worshippers every morning.*
* Oakland‚ÄîJack London Square *I‚Äôd sometimes find myself here after shows at the Fox Theater. There are lots of great plaques to read, if you‚Äôre into that. There‚Äôs also a fantastic Thai restaurant--at the least, try one of their desserts--a replica of Jack London‚Äôs Alaskan cabin, and plenty of quiet docks to watch the water from.*

# Scenic Walks

* Codornices back trails *Find the fence covered in paintings on the northern end of the park. There‚Äôs also a beautiful glade of wild onion flowers that gets trampled every year by seniors taking photos, don‚Äôt be like them.*
* Ohlone Park & Berkeley Greenway; bike it to Solano or Richmond *You‚Äôll pass community gardens, dog parks, and street art.*
* Albany Hill
* [Mark‚Äôs Yard Art](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mark-oliviers-yard-art)
* Blake Gardens
* Orchard Lane
* Berkeley [**Poetry**](http://berkeleyplaques.org/plaque/poetry-garden/?cat=33) **Garden** *Ginsburg was here. Kerouac too. Maybe you someday. Probably not.*
* Big C & fire trails.  *If you‚Äôre lucky, you might encounter some goats in the hills.*
* Wander the neighborhoods of North Berkeley *I usually start on Euclid to the Rose Walk (which was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps) and from there take as many staircases as possible. There‚Äôs a Monastery with a fantastic view of the Bay if you can find it, and Grizzly Peak Blvd, not to be confused with Grizzly Peak Overlook, is one of my favorite places to catch the sunset. If earthquakes and finances weren‚Äôt an issue, would you live here?*
* **Berkeley Rock Parks** *I like grabbing a chicken sandwich and potato puffs from Gregoire‚Äôs before embarking on a journey to any one of these:*

>Live Oak Park (good for lunch dates since it‚Äôs near Gourmet Ghetto)  
>  
>Indian Rock  
>  
>The vastly underrated Mortar Rock Park  
>  
>Grotto Rock  
>  
>Cragmont Rock (good for rappelling if you have the equipment)  
>  
>Remillard  
>  
>Great Stoneface Park (explore Thousand Oaks--look for the urns designating the turn-of-the-century boundaries, as well as the indentations in the rock where Ohlone people would grind acorns) & all of the natural boulders worked into the neighborhood nearby  
>  
>John Hinkel Park (sometimes an outdoor music venue; pretty, ivy-covered walkways. I‚Äôd call it romantic.)","[{'author': 'squillavilla', 'body': ""I throw this in since I used to work there when I was an undergrad:\n\nCheck out the archives and the Bancroft Library.

134,lb9wg4,denial_man,382.0,0.98,14,berkeley,"I'm a resident of unit 3, and someone on my floor contracted COVID. I received a notification from University Health Services about possibly having to move to Foothill, and the next day I received a text from someone at Tang saying they were sending a bus for me at 2:50pm. I asked them where the pickup would be, and I got NO RESPONSE. So at exactly 2:50pm, I dragged my luggage downstairs and checked for myself. There was a bus parked on my street, and two other kids were on it with their luggage as well. When I made eye contact with the driver, they waved me onboard. I figured, as any rational person would, that this was my ride. 

A few HOURS later, after arriving and checking in at Foothill, I FINALLY got a response from the person at Tang. They said there had been a ""transport problem"" and that I would be ""transported later today"". Well what the fck? I'd already been transported! I was AT Foothill! What's going on??

Turns out the bus I had gotten on WASN'T the right one. As a matter of fact, the next day (after texting my other floormates at unit 3), I found out that the delayed transport for our floor had been CANCELLED altogether. Because our most recent tests -- which were from AFTER the last point of contact with the COVID positive person -- had come back as negative, AND none of us were showing any symptoms, UHS had apparently decided that our floor was low-risk enough that we could quarantine in our own rooms (this might have had something to do with Foothill running out of room, but I'm still not sure about that). 

Well that's just fcking marvelous! I never had to come to Foothill in the first place! Here I was, imprisoned in a hotspot zone swarming with high-risk students, for absolutely no reason. My parents were similarly alarmed, and I spent the next two days calling every UHS contact I could find on their website, trying to explain my situation and begging to be sent back to unit 3. Over and over I was either rejected, transferred to similarly useless representatives, or told that someone would call me back later which, of course, never happened. It was ridiculous. I told my story countless times, but no one seemed to know what to do about it. 

Today, we got tested for COVID, and I had had enough. I demanded the UHS representative administering the tests connect me to someone of authority so I could explain my situation directly. I was still entirely lost on why I was being kept at Foothill, why no one I had talked to previously from UHS could explain my situation, and why I wasn't allowed to return to sequester at Unit 3 like all the other students on my floor. 

It was at this point, after three consecutive days of spamming UHS, that I finally got a call from THEM. This representative (we'll call him John) was the first person I had talked to who seemed like they knew what they were doing. John listened to my whole story, asked a few questions, and finally told me the truth: The bus I had been mistakenly told to board at 2:50pm was never meant for low-risk students -- it was meant for high-risk students, people whose direct friends and contacts had tested positive. While my association to the person on our floor who tested positive was simply that we had shared a communal bathroom, the two people on the bus with me had been hanging out, eating, and INDOORS UNMASKED with people who were COVID POSITIVE. As a matter of fact, one of the two people on that bus with me has gotten tested shortly after arriving at Foothill, and is now CONFIRMED POSITIVE for COVID.

John explained that THIS was the real reason why I was being kept in quarantine. Not because I had shared a bathroom with someone who was positive, but because the bus I had been wrongfully put on contained both a high-risk student and a COVID-positive student, and because I had sat with them in that indoor confined space for almost 15 minutes on the way to Foothill. As a result, I'm being kept at Foothill until the test I took today (fingers crossed) comes back as negative, at which point John guaranteed me I would be transported back to my room at Unit 3. 

To anyone working at UHS or the Tang Center who comes across this post, please let someone know that something HAS to be changed with this transport system. There needs to be some kind of check-in when the student gets on the bus to make sure they're the right person, some kind of ID-scan or even a verbal confirmation. SOMETHING. I had no idea I had gotten on the wrong bus, which is what will happen to other students in the future when the only information they are provided is a pickup time. 

And to the person at Tang who didn't reply to my many texts, who completely and utterly failed to punctually provide critical communication, YOU ARE THE REASON a very low-risk student was put in a confined indoor space with a COVID-positive person. You directly put me at risk for COVID with your flawed information and lack of timely responses. If my test comes back positive in two days, I blame you. It's laughable that your ONE JOB is to text students the necessary information to get them on a bus safely, and you managed to fck it up so badly. HOURS after the appointed pickup time. It took you HOURS to tell me that there had been a transport problem, that my bus was never there. Even if I test negative, you have severely inconvenienced me for the last four days, moving all my stuff into Foothill and studying in an foreign environment. Let alone the damage to my mental health sitting alone in this building for days wondering why I'm even here. I sincerely hope you get fired, this kind of mistake is inexcusable when you have the lives of students in your hands. 

TLDR: Someone on my floor got covid, I was mistakenly told by a Tang worker to get on a bus to Foothill -- WITH A COVID-POSITIVE PERSON ONBOARD. Screw the Tang worker who gave me wrong information and put me at risk for covid.","[{'author': 'matteophysics', 'body': 'This post literally just kept getting worse and worse and worse.

137,lr6459,dangotone,358.0,0.99,70,berkeley,"Letter written by Satish Rao to his colleagues about the new CS declaration policy:

>Dear Colleagues,  
>  
>I tend to go to L&S graduation. The speeches are nice, the energy is great, and well, the reading of names is interminable.  
>  
>Still, the moments are special. For example, when a parent says ""thank you"", and I respond with some form of ""it's my privilege"" or ""no. thank you for your part in your kid being here"" are meaningful. Not so much as moments, but as a reflection on their child, their  guidance, and  honestly the privilege we have in helping in some small way to move their child along that path.  
>  
>This is a path we will no longer provide for 700 students in the future; they will be missing from future L&S graduations. The loss of value to them and to the world is staggering. Indeed, it may well trivialize the loss to put a dollar value on this. (Though, I have succumbed to this on occasion.)  
>  
>To be sure, we will continue to do a great deal of good. There will be another several hundred that we will teach.  Indeed, it's more than paying our dues. Indeed, it's wonderful and really puts us above criticism.  
>  
>But is it  really so bad for us and others to provide what we do?  
>  
>**Our Workload**  
>  
>Is it even significantly harder than what is proposed?  
>  
>Personally, I feel my life will be much harder.  I am now a second level manager with a devoted staff that is  optimized to do the myriad of mundane and exceptional tasks that one needs to run any course, much less a fairly large one.   As one of our colleagues put it in the faculty discussions on course managers, ""Oh, when I get a student request that requires administrative work, I just forward it to the appropriate TA.""  We have websites, piazzas, gradescopes, content repos, and associated practices that are learned and passed on. The content teams produce content where for some of us, we can simply review and comment on their output. Moreover, my undergraduates listen and are effective. Graduate students (engaged ones) contribute to content where their capabilities are most useful and in a capacity they learn from.   
>  
>Teaching a 250 person course, for me, is tough. The lack of continuity in staff leads to problems and overwork, and graduate students in particular are overburdened to have to learn infrastructure and management of complexities that have little to do with their intellect and value and distract them far more from their research than doing content roles that they currently occupy. To be sure, I tend to try to insulate my graduate student TA's as I have done it before but it is still a lot of work.  
>  
>To be sure, with our workload system, 250 or 300 person course gets essentially the same teaching credit as an 800 person one, but as noted the administrative load is tremendous for the 250-300 person course even while some issues scale with size.   
>  
>As Scheduling Officer (which I did for 6 years), I noticed, faculty themselves increased the sizes of their courses as they grew better and more comfortable with managing them. Perhaps they did this due to community precedent; perhaps they did it when faced with eager students. Whatever the reason you did generally grow your courses to accommodate students.   
>  
>Indeed, what is impressive is that students' perceived quality of our courses has grown even as the sizes have grown. It's a testament to you and a measure of what will be lost.  
>  
>**GPA Threshold**  
>  
>There are many who criticize this aspect of our program. I believe this is worth a detailed response as I believe some of it is unfair and overstated.  
>  
>The declaration process is three courses: 61A, 61B, and 70. I taught CS70 a lot: 8 times in the last 6 years.  
>  
>When I  teach it and award grades on whether a standard is met not to put up a barrier. The standard for a B+ is whether a student (with generous room for growth) is prepared for our program in the upper division at the level that it is and should be taught.   
>  
>Moreover, we make serious efforts to make sure expectations are clear and that those expectations can be met by understanding the ample course materials, and with a system of TA support that should enable students to get well above the basic level of preparation that is the standard.  
>  
>It's true that some students don't get in. One wonders why. I have experience with this. Students who have done poorly on the midterm often ask for time with me, and they receive it.  We go over their understanding and process. We go from question on the exam, to reading the notes in as relaxed a method as possible.  We work on improving their approach to learning; e.g., focus on understanding the basics, and using those basics to build up both intuition and mathematical power. An example, might be they should understand that .5 has no meaning in modular arithmetic. It's a bit uncomfortable for them,  in that it is different from manipulating equations or following recipes (which was drummed into them K-12) and asks them to understand the path. Still, they can (essentially)  always make progress in our meetings and often even have Eureka moments about what it means to know and the power to produce that knowing. I believe (essentially) all students are capable and  are not very far from doing really well in the course and certainly getting to the fairly basic level that defines a B+.   
>  
>But for whatever reason, even with this support, somehow the students do something different and don't get to the standard that earns them a B+. It is perhaps due to lack of interest or other issues. Personally, issues of background to me, is more  a problem of lower confidence than lack of prior knowledge. To be clear, attaining an A+ or A is something where previous knowledge helps considerably, but attaining a B+ is more of a confidence issue in my view. This is something I do try to address with those students; ""you can do this, don't worry about others.""  
>  
>In terms of the upper division which I also teach regularly, this level of preparation allows a level of pedagogy that is consistent with the  quality of our program.  While I personally let in everyone into my upper division courses, I indicate they are taught for our majors and keep that promise. This fair warning does communicate expectations to those who are not our majors and they  don't complain about level inordinately and this allows the courses to run more smoothly than if our majors were unprepared.  
>  
>The quality produced by this process is also impressive. We choose 1000 students who do as well as the 300 students in our EECS major.  Indeed, this appears true in our upper division courses not just in overall GPA.  The EECS major is the most competitive major on campus in terms of admission: the rate of admission (5-6%) is lower than MIT's or Caltech's.  Our declaration threshold is surprisingly (shockingly) much better in that it chooses a much larger group of comparable quality.  
>  
>Then again, it's perhaps not that shocking as admissions chooses students based on the sophomore and junior performance in high school. This is perhaps why L&S has the declaration after coming.  It takes time to explore and to develop as people. Freshman admissions selects for those who develop quickly. We are judging by their 15-17 year old behaviors. Our students are still young, but there is a lot of development in those couple of years. I raised three kids mostly as a single parent, it's true in my experience.  
>  
>Moreover, admissions will get noisier as whatever the criticisms around standardized tests, the SAT has been studied by a group of 26 UC faculty who found it to be an invaluable tool for assessing preparation for succeeding in the UC system.  
>  
>To be sure, I believe our system is a clear system where students have control over their destiny in a very imperfect world full of mystical selection processes. The standard we apply is: here take these three courses, where we work very hard to clearly communicate standards and support you to get much higher than that, and then and only then do we apply the standard.  
>  
>In terms of harm to students who don't make it. Only a fraction take all three and those who take any subset of 61A and 61B and even 70 are  courses that offer invaluable skills in today's world and  fulfill requirements for several other majors.  It's a path optimized to be short. Thus, the delay to choosing the major is not long, for most it is one or two courses. Last semester in CS70, the undeclared L&S students who received a B or lower was 71. Let's take this as a proxy for those who don't make it, though it is probably an upper bound as grades tend to drop through the series. This estimate is roughly 15-20% of the population of around 1000 that become our majors,  so around 80-85% of those who try three courses make it. (Caveat: there is a small mathematical mistake which understates the percentage who make it, but correct mathematics is less intuitive and it's an estimate anyway.)    
>  
>**Diversity.**  
>  
>First, the non-male population is larger in L&S CS than EECS and to me, many of the women from L&S CS are discoverers. To be sure, society improves and whatever we do, this should increase.  Indeed, parents hopefully increasingly understand that protecting their children means empowering them. Our field provides power.  
>  
>Still, we need to continue to broaden with respect to URM. CS Scholars is great and we continue to support it.   But we can take more measures like varying the threshold in according to other conditions. [Berkeley admissions](https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/07/16/uc-berkeleys-push-for-more-diversity-shows-in-its-newly-admitted-class/) last year made remarkable progress in terms of diversity.  Two numbers that indicate interesting mechanisms for us are Pell Grant recipients which grew from an already large 4556 to  5106. Another is the first generation college applicants which grew from 3118 to 4106 students.  These two categories may well have to do with other improvements in diversity. These are large pools from which we can recruit from in our system; adjusting the GPA to be different for these categories is completely legal and reasonable. Moreover, to me, a poor student who achieves at a similar level to a wealthy student is inherently stronger (Indeed, I have been pushing for a publicly announced Pell Grant gpa threshold for declaration for almost two years).  
>  
>Finally, while cutting our program by a factor of three may improve diversity percentages, it could well decrease the total number of diverse students dramatically.  Access is generally not well served by massively cutting seats.  
>  
>**Finances.**  
>  
>Well.  UC Berkeley has a budget of 3B and spends on the order of 100M-150M on TAS. Specifically to teaching, the state provides 350M (which is roughly equivalent to the proceeds from a 9 Billion dollar endowment), and more for CalGrants which helps fund tuition receipts of roughly 750M, and we also receive another couple of hundred million in donations and revenue from our endowment. (Other income comes primarily from research, and then from housing and other activities. )  
>  
>We need a few million extra in TAS. These monies would directly serve and is frankly owed to our students in terms of what they pay and what is paid on their behalf.  It's not surprising that our Frankensteinian combination of bureaucratic/corporatist administration siphons off vast sums of money from the basic mission. Still, at some point, it violates ethical sensibilities even if it is somehow completely legal.   
>  
>I don't know what to do, specifically. Still, if we admire those willing to fight corruption against impossible odds with great courage, perhaps pushing harder is more appropriate than using manufactured scarcity to justify sacrificing the massive value we produce.  
>  
>**Perspective.**  
>  
>When my kids complained too much, I would occasionally jump up and turn on the faucet and exclaim: ""Look! Clean, running water."" Then, to totally overdo the theme, I would run to the light switch: ""Let there be light."" I am astounded these things are a thing. Who makes this happen? How does it keep happening? It's a miracle, really, a miracle.

138,10r3j5d,d_trenton,407.0,0.99,38,berkeley,"Inspired by the post by the salty Berkeley High student who made some valid points but in a way that turned people wayyy off. This is just based off stuff I've seen on AC Transit from people who maybe aren't familiar with riding the bus, please comment if you have other things. This is meant as a judgment-free thread. 

-When the bus pulls up to the stop, let other people get off the bus before getting on. If someone with a mobility aid is getting off, sometimes the driver will deploy a ramp for them from the front door. Move back and let them pass.

-If the bus is crowded (or likely to get crowded), move as far to the back of the bus as possible to make room. If there's an open seat, take it, even if it's next to a stranger. You're still helping to make room on the bus by doing so. I can't tell you how many times I've seen people standing in the aisle who are blocking others from getting to seats.

-If you're standing in a crowded bus, take off your backpack to make room. (That goes for crowded BART cars too.) 

-If you're trying to get off a crowded bus and people aren't moving, don't scream or shove, but say something along the lines of ""excuse me, please let me off."" Sometimes people are in your way because they're letting other people off, so just give it a second. 

-Sometimes the bus is so crowded (cough 51B cough) that you have to stand next to the back doors. If that happens, allow people to exit by temporarily stepping off the bus and then stepping back on after people have exited. Keep an arm on the door if you're worried about them closing--it doesn't take much force to stop them. 

-Obviously if you're in the priority seating for the elderly and people with mobility aids (and you're not elderly or using a mobility aid), be ready to give up your seat to someone who needs it. Even if you're not in priority seating, it's considered polite to offer your seat to someone who needs it (a senior citizen, a parent with a baby, etc.) 

-If you're sitting in an aisle seat and the person in the seat next to you is getting off, get up and let them pass. Please don't just swing your legs into the aisle or lean away from them. If they have stuff they are carrying (backpack, big purse, baby in lap, whatever ) they will need room to maneuver into the aisle. You probably don't want them losing their balance and dropping that stuff on you.

-Maybe this is just me, but it's kind of gross when people eat on the bus, and it's technically not allowed but I've never seen a driver enforce it. Drinks (not the adult kind) are usually fine. I have seen drivers tell people to dump soda cups, but I've never had one give me a hard time for a coffee cup.

-Not etiquette but a pro tip that a bus driver told me once: if you're ever at poorly-lit bus stop at night and worried the bus will blow past you, turn the flashlight of your phone on. It makes you easier for the driver to see.

As a disabled rider, I\'d like to add a couple notes as well. ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\n----------------------------------\n\nBus Tips for Beginners: Accessibility Edition\n\n1) üåü If you do not need access to priority seating yourself, please proactively offer your seat if you see another passenger using a mobility aid. üíØ\n\n2) üëç Please remember: Not all disabled people who need access to seats will be using an obvious mobility aid. \U0001fa7c\n\nAccess to priority seating does not require \'proof.\' \n\nIf someone asks for your seat because they are disabled/cannot stand safely, they are not obligated to offer you proof of any kind, nor submit to questioning regarding their medical diagnoses.  üôÖ\u200d‚ôÇÔ∏è ‚ÅâÔ∏è\U0001fa7b\n\nJust because someone \'looks fine\', or doesn\'t \'look sick\' doesn\'t mean anything. Access to priority seating is not restricted to the obviously elderly, blind passengers using a white cane, or passengers using a cane/walker/wheelchair or crutches. \n\nSome examples of \'invisible\' disabilities that may require access to priority seating: arthritis, injury from a car accident, prosthetic limb under clothing, connective tissue disorders, fainting disorders, fatigue from chemo, numbness in the legs, poor circulation, and even pregnancy. \n\n3) ‚ôø ""Priority Seating"" üßëüèª\u200d\U0001f9bc\n\nPriority seating is generally considered to be the sideways facing seats at the front of the bus, and the first couple rows of forward facing seats. However signage varies from bus to bus. And some buses only have \'priority seating\' signage over the sideways facing seats. \n\nThe sideways seats are important for several reasons. They are at the front of the bus so passengers with difficulties do not need to maneuver past as many people.(And so they can hopefully get seated before the bus resumes moving.) These sideways seats also fold up in order to make floor space for a walker, or access wheelchair strap-down/securement areas. \n\nHowever, for some people with disabilities (including myself), sitting in the sideways seats can cause both pain and injuries. \nWhen the bus accelerates/decelerates, we need something to lean against so we don\'t go flying. (I personally have musculoskeletal issues, which you can\'t see by looking at me. So my joints/connective tissue cannot hold up to sideways force.)\nSo having access to forward-facing seats is much safer for some of us! \n\n4) üöè Getting On/Off the Bus üë®üèª\u200d\U0001f9af üöå\n\nThank you for suggesting a pause before boarding. The same people who need priority seating may need to exit at the front of the bus instead of thru the back door.  Make sure to allow any passengers to disembark before boarding the bus yourself. \n\nIf you are able, please disembark the bus using the back door. This helps keep things moving, and speeds up the process by leaving more space at the front of the bus for those who need it. \n\n5) üë©üèæ\u200d\U0001f9bd Front Door Access üöç\n\nThe most obvious reason to utilize the front door is the ramp, as you mentioned. The ramp is super important to both walker and wheelchair users. Certain strollers need access to the ramp as well.\n\nNot all disabled passengers require the ramp itself, but still need to use the front door to both board and disembark.\n\nI personally avoid the back door, because the step-down /drop-down to the curb can be several feet high. This is dangerous for those of us with mobility impairments.\n\nLuckily, the bus driver can \'kneel\' the bus when a passenger exits via the front door. Bus kneeling uses air/hydraulics to lower the front end of the bus. The kneeling process will be accompanied by a whooshing sound and electronic beeping. \n\nKneeling helps minimize the step between the bus and the curb, making it much more manageable.  And is especially necessary for passengers using walkers, strollers, etc.  \n\n--------------------------------\n\nFeel free to ask me questions!

### Motivations

I wrote this constructive critique to motivate CS70 and other similarly dense and not beginner friendly material courses to follow suit in the suggestions I give. CS70 staff likely know who I am and if you would like to have a more in-depth discussion, please feel free to reach out :)

### Establishing Credibility/Reputability

To preface: I have (and when I say this, I‚Äôm not exaggerating) studied on average ~10hrs every single day of this entire semester. From 1/18 till 5/12, I have spent approximately 900 hours on CS70 alone, which doesn‚Äôt include office hours or discussions or CSM sections. I go to 4 discussions per week (2 different TAs) and I always stay late to ask questions. Additionally, I attend 2 CSM sections per week, I go to OH every day, I have a tutor, post on Piazza and Discord anytime I‚Äôm confused, and I spend my entire day from start to finish in the library studying JUST 70. Think I‚Äôm overexaggerating or lying? My hours are tracked, 70 also has a log of all my OH tickets, and my discussion TAs, and OH staff can back this as well.

&nbsp;

**Why do I feel like I‚Äôm qualified to critique the course?** I have significant prior experience privately tutoring students before and have had substantial involvement in the sequencing, design, and structuring of 3 different courses as well as development of course material at my high school (internationally recognized for one of the courses). And as previously mentioned, I have followed and done everything as recommended by the course staff, Rao/Sahai, and others on how to study/‚Äùsurvive‚Äù in cs70.

---

#1) Overall

Let me be very clear, this course is not equitable. In fact, this is emblematic of a much larger issue: none of the lower-divs (mainly 61A & CS70) are. In 61A alone, prior experience is the single most significant predictor of success; according to Pamela, only 15% of NPE students get a B+ or higher. In CS70, this gap is way bigger and they probably have the data to support this claim; students with prior exposure to competitive or rigorous math at any level pre-college whether it‚Äôs USAMO, USACO, AIME, AMC or multivariable/linear algebra at a local college have a MASSIVE advantage. It‚Äôs a compounding advantage because those with prior exposure need to spend less time to understand the material (the so-called ‚Äúmathematical maturity‚Äù). More precisely, their per unit of time spent has a faster rate of change (their score) versus NPE students. Lower-income students also oftentimes have to work to support themselves while in school, so the only gap-closer (spending more time on the material) is now no longer an available option. I say this as a first-gen student coming from a low-income background where the highest level of math taught at my high school is Elementary Calculus. Not everyone had the ability to take rigorous math nor was put through it. Specifically, my school only offered Integrated Math I, II, III, then ‚ÄúAP‚Äù Calc. 

&nbsp;

The course is WAY TOO FAST-PACED yet expects students to be able to reproduce every proof from a note that we read the day before. The goal of the class commonly said by Rao, Sahai, and CS70 TAs is to ‚Äúencourage learning‚Äù or to ‚Äújust learn the material and you will do fine.‚Äù This fails to acknowledge that the barrier to entry is way higher compared to 61A or 61B; **CS70 artificially inflates the difficulty of the course by intentionally creating a scarcity of resources** (or not investing time into developing resources), which I would argue is contradictory to this commonly spouted goal of ‚Äúencouraging learning."" ‚ÄúThis is hard material‚Äù is not a sufficient excuse for poor presentation and teaching of material (both in the notes and in lecture). Furthermore, from my experience interacting with course staff in OH every single day and other mediums, it‚Äôs also clear that the hiring practices significantly prioritize grades over teaching capacity. I along with many others intentionally try to avoid certain course staff in OH because we consistently run into the same one-dimensional math comp explanations. Yes, the material is hard, but you do not have to make it any harder than it already is. 

---



#2) Lectures

My main point is this: the lecture should be intended as an introductory aid i.e a conceptual overview of all the main important pieces of the topic (ex: show FLT proof but not derangement, leave that for the note). This flows perfectly since notes should be used to deepen the understanding and discussion is used for application of the theory.

&nbsp;

An overwhelming majority of students will tell you that lecture is useless (supported by student survey data as well) and it‚Äôs motivated by a variety of factors. I will mainly address the slides i.e the presentation of material in lecture in this section. 

&nbsp;

According to Professor Sen, lecture slides are said to never be changed or modified in any way no matter the professor (rules by the dept apparently?). I strongly disagree and so does the educational research. Lectures should include more visual aid and more colors instead of just black, blue, red. Colors help viewers stay focused instead of getting lost in a wall of all black text. Colors and graphic images help a ton with conceptual understanding and distinguishing what‚Äôs important and what to focus on. This could be something like putting a colored box around the theorem statement to make it easy to distinguish what the overarching statement is and then the proof in a different colored box can be formatted like a step by step tutorial (literally put step 1, step 2, and what we‚Äôre doing in each step) where every little detail is pointed out. This could be something as small as writing an arrow saying that this part of the expression is to account for the cookies, and this * 2 is for symmetry since bla bla. Most importantly, stop skipping on things you consider trivial- these are things that get students stuck from minutes to hours. Common instances of this are jumping 3 steps in a proof or implicitly making a simplification that YOU consider trivial. 

&nbsp;

Sometimes, slides legitimately just don‚Äôt cut it and that‚Äôs why you have the lecturer there. They should be there to guide you through their thought process and how they approach it instead of brainlessly clicking through slides. Literally write out your steps instead of rambling out loud what the steps are- literally write it out- write out where we are, then the next step, and then the next and explain while doing it. This provides a visual aid to focus on and the exact thing to associate with the explanation coming out of the lecturer‚Äôs mouth. Again, I can not stress this enough: visually walk the viewer through the proof instead of telling it to them and then having a bunch of slides spam clicked. The reason students come to lecture is to pick up what the slides alone cannot convey and it‚Äôs the rationale for each step, the thought process, the conceptual intuitive meaning.

#3) Notes

The notes are massive time sinks that are unnecessarily convoluted and overly complex for no reasons. The argument that this is how math is presented and that other courses later on will be way worse are bad cop-outs for putting in actual work into synthesizing and boiling down material into layman terms that people (undergrads) can actually understand. 

&nbsp;

The notes are literally pages and pages full of walls of black text. Add some freaking colors, box the theorem in blue, highlight the equation in red, or even something as simple as putting a visual of probability space A and B and their overlap and coloring it, or coloring the cycle of a graph. 

&nbsp;

Intentionally designing things by selectively excluding clear explanations or step-by-steps doesn‚Äôt help stimulate learning, it just confuses and angers students; for example, a visual step-by-step on how to build hypercubes and assign their bit strings instead of saying it in a one-liner in a gigantic wall of text. Why conceal information about how to deal with E[min(X, Y)] instead of explaining that you could convert it to P(X > t, Y > t)? Students don‚Äôt have unlimited time and it‚Äôs clear that our time isn‚Äôt respected; you can not reasonably expect a student to spend 30 hours on this course alone. 

&nbsp;

These are intentional choices made to artificially make the course more difficult and arduous than it needs to be. For students who don‚Äôt have time to spare this has a disproportionately worse effect (this group tends to be lower income folks, minority groups, less privileged). 

&nbsp;

The example of assigning bit strings on a hypercube is just one example (off the top of my head) of a concept that students routinely get confused on. If students ROUTINELY ask questions and have trouble with X topic or Y question every single semester, shouldn‚Äôt it warrant looking into? It clearly means that the explanation is not good enough. There‚Äôs a difference between trying to induce confusion to stimulate growth and a clear lack of a proper explanation.

#4) Exams / Walkthroughs / Recordings

To be blunt: make better solutions or make exam walkthrough videos. Potential suggestion is to have a TA make videos doing a conceptual overview of topics like Sahai did for the Sp2014 semester (can be viewed on YouTube). These short 10-15 mins videos made by Sahai and other course staff are phenomenal material that provide additional resources for students to access beyond just the notes and slides. 

&nbsp;

Exam solutions should be written like Alec Li‚Äôs Fall 2020 Final rewritten solutions. Every single step should be broken down (stop skipping steps, stop saying X is trivial, blabla) in laymen terms and how to conceptually think about it and the different ways you could approach it. 

&nbsp;

I‚Äôve previously spoken with Tarang about past exam walkthroughs. CS70 used to do this in the past but stopped for some reason. His reasoning was that ‚Äúwe want to encourage learning,‚Äù but that is contradictory. 

&nbsp;

If your whole goal is to encourage learning, why offer a no-HW option? If anything, by that logic then all students should be required to do the HW not only for structural/disciplinary measures but to also develop a better conceptual understanding. Clearly, this isn‚Äôt the case and by offering a no-HW option the course actively supports the testing approach which goes directly against the whole ‚Äúencourage learning‚Äù goal.

&nbsp;

### Other related suggestions:
61AB has a plethora of resources, so that even when you‚Äôre stuck you can find resources to help you get unblocked. Exam prep videos, exam prep sections, NPE sections, videos specifically about recursive runtime, or 61C‚Äôs catchup sections. In 70, you have lectures (which majority of people do not watch), notes, and in-person discussion (if you end up not being able to go, tough luck! If you forget the nitty gritty of what was covered, tough luck too!).

&nbsp;

The benefit of developing these materials starting now is that it will pay absolute dividends in the long-term. For example, students still watch the Enigma/Gitlet explanation videos from 61B which were made years ago. It‚Äôs not like mod arithmetic, for example, will suddenly change 20 years down the road.

&nbsp;

Here‚Äôs what you should do: build a database of resources, reuse it semester-to-semester ‚Üí this reduces the workload of OH, TA‚Äôs, etc in the long-term and also saves on cost/time! That‚Äôs all to say that the second-order effects are huge. In fact, if the whole goal of the course, commonly said by Sahai and Rao, is to ‚Äújust learn the material‚Äù then why restrict resources to force people to interact with course staff? Why create extra barriers to resources to enforce your methodology?   

### Suggestions:
* Discussion Walkthrough videos:
     * Data 100 releases discussion walkthroughs intentionally a week late to encourage people to go to live discussion
     * Ex: [Data 100 Fa19 Discussion 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CiUCgSr-Mg)
* Concept walkthrough videos i.e RSA, Mod Arithmetic
     * Ex: [61B Asymptotics Introduction](https://youtu.be/bBqfehNv7mQ)

* NPE/Behind/LOST/Exam-prep Discussion sections
     * 61A, 61B, 61C, 189, 170, Data 100 all have some variant of these

#5) Teaching Pedagogy / Hiring Practices
The hiring practices are based primarily on grades. While Richard has pointed out that CS70 no longer solely relies on an algorithm to assign points based on grades, it doesn‚Äôt take a genius to figure out that most of course staff and especially readers are math comp kids. 

&nbsp;

The main reason for bringing this up is because those who come from rigorous math backgrounds or ones where they've likely competed in USAMO, USACO, AIME, AMC or taken multivar, lin alg, discrete, etc before even coming to Berkeley are gonna naturally be ones to do well in the course. Doing well in the course translates to better odds of getting hired. And funnily enough, out of the 48 cs70 course staff members who responded to the internal poll about comp math: 27 did comp math in HS, 9 did comp math but only in middle school, 12 never participated in math competitions. Now, I‚Äôm not a stats guy but that looks like an overwhelming majority to me. I want to be clear that it‚Äôs not problematic that they come from rigorous backgrounds, because I have received help from fantastic readers and TAs with a comp math background and they were great- but the flipside is that my poor experiences (as of many others) have mainly come from those with comp math backgrounds whereas I have had absolutely no issues from those without comp math background.

&nbsp;

It's very clear that this is true when a reader/TA gives an explanation that is one-dimensional; one that is likely derived from a math comp perspective. I have routinely had poor experiences with certain readers and TAs in OH, so much so that I along with many other students try our best to avoid them. Do you know how humiliating and demeaning it is to ask for help KNOWING that the person helping you will condescendingly mock you (most of the time implicit or implied, never direct) because you value the help more than getting degraded? In 61A and 61B, asking for help never felt like I was being ridiculed or looked down on. Yet, at 70, I feel it at every step. 

###Suggestions:
Introducing/encouraging course staff that comes from different backgrounds (non math comp, low rigor HS) would be a great addition. Another focus could be a better filtering mechanism. I like the approach that 61A and 61B take where you have to teach a concept to current course staff who role-play as students and ask student-like questions- teaching extends beyond just grades; someone with an B+ could be a WAY better teacher than someone who never struggled and got an A. If a course staff member feels that they communicate better over Piazza/Discord/Online, that should be a role/responsibility instead of shoveling everyone into a people-facing role which could have an adverse effect. As aforementioned in the previous section, within the content team one of the highly rated TAs responsible for those walkthroughs/recordings!

&nbsp;

It is SO important that the people joining course staff are non-judgemental, welcoming, and patient. The impact that these people have on students extends beyond just learning, it goes deep and emotional.

&nbsp;

**TL;DR: CS70 is made artificially harder by creating a scarcity of resources. The course is not equitable and heavily disadvantages minorities & lower-income students because they likely haven't taken rigorous math needed and are more likely to work during school. Slides and notes have a lot of room to improve, and ""this is hard material"" isn't a sufficient excuse for poor presentation. CS70 should make walkthrough videos (discussion, hw, concept, etc) and not doing so goes against their own goal of ""encouraging learning"" by restricting resources. Furthermore, hiring practices are skewed and majority of course staff come from comp math or rigorous math backgrounds, which becomes problematic when students poor experiences are a result of one-dimensional math comp explanations.**","[{'author': 'ProfessorPlum168', 'body': 'There‚Äôs still a ton of HS‚Äôs out there where the advanced curriculum is to start with Algebra in 9th grade and end with pre-Calc in 12th grade.

The easiest way to resolve the issues is to split the course into a 2 semester sequence that actually takes the time to teach you how to do proofs and why proofs matter in CS.\n\nAlso take out the probability module. I understand that it has bearing on other classes in CS, but... there are dedicated classes that teach you the material properly in the departments that teach these things for a living (stats, math).\n\nThat said, I also disagree with OP\'s take on the ""skewed hiring practices"" - mathematics is mostly about imitating the proofs and solutions of other people until you get it. The pool of people who ""get math"" to the level that it is required in the CS70 curriculum is already small enough - would you rather be imitating someone who ""gets it"" or who ""doesn\'t get it""?

They are also trying to make it ‚Äúsexy‚Äù by teaching advanced topics like RSA, error-correcting codes, and linear regression.\n\nConventionally, math is taught by first providing a bit of motivation for a concept, then the concept is given a rigorous definition, then simple claims are proven, then its properties are explored, and finally some proof of a minor or major theorem is given. The proofs are often chosen to illustrate new mathematical techniques. \n\nIn CS70, there's some motivation but concepts are not defined with rigor, there's no time, so simple properties are not explored, not shown and not proven, and we jump directly to some proofs that students are not equipped to understand.  Students are in a constant mathematical haze.\n\nFor example, to teach error correcting codes and secret sharing, you must first teach polynomials over finite fields.

Around 3:00 pm, when the riots had moved up to shattuck, a bystander with a camera was assaulted by a group of Antifa. One of the women started screaming at him for recording the riot ""without her consent."" He was called a Nazi, a rapist and a Trump supporter. He told the woman he hated Trump, had voted for both Bernie and Jill Stein, but she wouldn't stop calling him a Nazi. 

Meanwhile, a masked guy snuck up behind him, grabbed everything in his pocket and ran off. The guy was like ""oh gee, thanks you guys. I lost my fucking house key and now I won't be able to go home."" The girl was like ""well some people don't even have fucking homes!!!"" (*this made me cringe so hard*).

A mob of these guys then surrounded him and continued calling him a Nazi while he kept repeating that he was anti-Trump. This is when the guy who had taken his keys came back with a fucking glass bottle and started chasing him, trying to smash it on his head. He got chased all the way to the other side of the street while people tried to grab/ trip him. 

I felt so fucking disgusted by all of this. I literally witnessed an innocent bystander being labeled a Nazi and a rapist as a justification to assault him. He did absolutely nothing wrong, was not involved in the Trump rally, and had every right to film on a public sidewalk.","[{'author': 'SleepyChino', 'body': ""Someone from the black bloc cracked a bottle over my homie's head.

147,yy57d9,clarity_now2,572.0,0.94,100,berkeley,"Hi folks! I'm Liam, a member of CS 170 course staff.

We are currently in the midst of the largest academic strike in US History ‚Äì as many of you have likely heard by now, over 48,000 academic workers are currently on strike. As of today, bargaining teams from all four academic bargaining units are attempting to negotiate with the University, and this small window of time will prove to be a crucial moment that must be capitalized on. The contract we decide on will govern us for years to come.

**Why you should strike/picket/support your staff:**

Students:

We are fighting for funding, specifically a more livable compensation for our teachers and a dedicated increase in EECS staffing from the UC. This will lead to a better learning experience for you as students, giving you advantages such as:

\- shorter OH queues

\- more small group tutoring

\- with more staff, you will be able to get into the classes you want to take

In addition to this, the students who are most vulnerable are those who were not privileged enough to receive extra academic preparation beforehand; students with less experience often have a difficult time in computer science, especially here at Berkeley, and it frequently results in them being turned away from it. This manifests itself in the following ways:

\- students are expected to do exceptionally well in our massively sized and difficult lower divs, yet are left to drown, lacking adequate course support

\- if students cannot pass the GPA requirement, they cannot even enroll in CS classes

\- non-majors, e.g. CS-cluster applied math majors, are not allowed to enroll in CS upper-divs period

\- the poor compensation and long hours make the (u)GSI position much less attractive to those who have to pay for school themselves(they could engage in private tutoring instead, or some other job that pays market rate), reducing the diversity in course staff and limiting access to these important jobs(which can be a stepping stone for an academic career) for underrepresented students

It is not hard to see that it is those students who are the least groomed-beforehand for CS (i.e. underprivileged students, the backbone of our diversity) that end up suffering the most; *if the University of California wants to continue to lay claim to its storied diversity, it must deal with the fact that it can only do so by diverting funding to the aspects of the school that actually serve to constitute and nurture this diversity.*

**Background on the strike for EECS:**

EECS has the largest population of academic workers on campus. Teaching quality has suffered. The way we've adapted is by resorting to more ""scalable"" options that aren't very productive for your learning, or for our assessment of your learning. We have created mass auto-graders to check your code instead of having a TA present to help you go line-by-line; the latter is how it should be, especially at the greatest public university in the country. We've resorted to multiple choice and short answer questions, discouraging creativity and stripping away from students the ability to explain why they chose what they chose ‚Äì  we've increasingly taken away the human aspect of teaching, the aspect of teaching that leaves permanent, endlessly inspirational impressions on students. Personalized feedback and guided assistance is the most effective way to learn. Without this, we might as well all go on coursera to learn from Andrew Ng and search up practice problems on our own and grade them on our own ‚Äì keep in mind how much you‚Äôre paying to be here. Is it so much to ask that courses be adequately staffed, in a non-exploitative manner? Because we cannot afford to hire more TAs, the quality of teaching in our department has really suffered. I‚Äôm sure many of you can attest to this.

In addition, lower division courses often have to rely on unpaid labor to adequately support students. Since they don't have enough money to hire more tutors and TAs, they often will rely on Academic Intern labor just to serve the course. I was both an AI and a volunteer for computer science mentors; Computer Science Mentors (CSM), a volunteering club, is also heavily sought after for assistance in the lower divisions. *To put it bluntly, the University of California is relying on unpaid volunteers in order to provide only the most basic academic infrastructure for their students*. It would be hard to call this anything but abhorrent and exploitative, and it has the stark consequence that the more vulnerable students who cannot afford to provide unpaid labor cannot get the experience they need in order to be competitive for a paid position; again, we claim to be committed to diversity here.

**Why I'm on strike:**

This is my 4th time on course staff.

OH queues are ridiculous. For example, the course I'm currently serving has 2-3 people staffing an office hours that regularly draws 30+ students, each of whom is different and deserves their own individualized assistance. This is all that we can afford. The homework in my class is hard, and more likely than not, each person needs a lot more time than the mere 10 minutes we allot to each student to understand the material. But there are more people in the queue, and unfortunately we just have to move on to the next person before adequate assistance can be given.

Here‚Äôs some simple math: in each block of one hour, each staff member can talk to 6 students on average. Since we have 2-3 staff, that means 12-18 students get help in an hour. There are 30 students and people are continually coming into OH for help. We simply cannot reach everyone in a timely manner. *I have friends that are discouraged from coming into office hours due to what is regularly a 2-3 hour long queue.*

I was a student in an upper division EECS class last year. I was at office hours once with 20+ students. There was one TA, who was there for one hour. Nonetheless, when that TA left, most of us were left no better off than we were before OH started. There were simply not enough people to staff that OH.

What would we do with more money? Staff OH properly. Hire more tutors for group tutoring! My course (CS 170) is difficult and people would benefit massively from small group tutoring, such that we can go through the algorithms and strategies together, and provide personalized feedback. We could afford to hire more people to read through your code and suggest best practices ‚Äì who doesn‚Äôt want this? We could get rid of the rubrics for design docs that make it hard for you to really learn. We could make exams that actually test your knowledge, in a manner that‚Äôs far more equitable and far more thought-provoking than a small fill-in box, or bubble-in circle.

The union is bargaining for a 50% increase in EECS hiring. This will allow us to have more properly staffed courses and an exceptional increase in teaching quality. *This is crucial for the EECS department. No more 3-hour OH queues. More spots in classes. Graduating on time.*

**There's another, arguably more important side to it:**

GSIs, ASEs, and lecturers are heavily overworked and underpaid. Due to a lack of staff, we often have to take up extra work ‚Äì we have to choose between our students and our own personal well-being. I've been forced to choose between a break in between my discussion and my office hours after a long day of work, or helping my students. This is tortuous because every single one of us feels a genuine, human obligation to our students. There are so many great things about teaching, and the university expects us to quietly bear the unnecessary hardships (overwork, underpay) just so we can do what we love. We as an academic community deserve to work with dignity ‚Äì we should not be told to keep our heads down and suck it up. It is a job.

Lecturers often have to cover for the lack of funding and it hurts them immensely, not to mention the fact that it just isn‚Äôt fair. For GSIs in particular: GSIs are rent-burdened, overworked, and especially underpaid. They are people like anybody else, and should not have to be living paycheck to paycheck, if they‚Äôre even managing that. They deserve a living wage, especially here in the bay where everything is just unthinkably expensive.

**What you as a student can do:**

\- Show support for your staff on Ed. Tell them you support them. Heart their strike posts on Ed, it means a lot

\- Make a post on Ed encouraging TAs who are on strike to keep striking, ans TAs who aren‚Äôt on strike yet to start striking

\- Show up to the picket line. Visibility is super important in a strike.

\- [Sign the community support petition](https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/uaw-undergraduate-letter-of-support?source=direct_link&).

\- Tell your friends who are indifferent about the strike why they should support the strike, and engage in proactive dialogues wrt the strike among your acquaintances.

**For those of you that feel that you have a duty to your students:**

Students are currently suffering, have been suffering, and will continue to face the consequences of understaffed courses until something changes. My heart sinks when I hear that my students are discouraged from coming into office hours because of 3-hour queues; I know, we all know that students greatly need more individualized support. Without any change, we will not be able to provide that which we know our students need. They deserve a better education than they are currently being provided, and in my opinion, fulfilling your duty to them means going on strike and picketing until UC can meet our demands. Only then will we be able to serve our students in the manner in which they should be served, as students at the #1 public university in the country.

**GSIs who are still going into work:**

\- You are likely overworked and underpaid.

\- There is little job security. For some PhD students, every semester is a new struggle to find funding, since not every PI has enough GSR funds, and GSI appointments are semester-by-semester

\- The quality of the education here will skyrocket with more funding. We will not have to resort to autograders and multiple choice questions ‚Äì this means a more fulfilling, and more importantly less soulless, teaching experience.

EECS especially has had to deal with the brunt of the UC's unfair labor practices. Classes are universally understaffed, students cannot enroll in classes that they want or even need to take, lecturers and TAs are heavily overworked, and there is little job security for researchers and academic employees alike.

**Why we need to be out on the picket line:**

*Withholding labor is only half the battle.*

Picketing is so important because it gives us the visibility that is needed to make real change at the university-wide level. This visibility goes very far in showing the University how much power we, as the academic workers at the school, hold. We do a large majority of the work in the EECS department and the University must be made to understand how crucial we are as academic workers to the everyday-functioning of the school. No academic workers means no UC Berkeley. If we just sat at home and did nothing, the university would not care or notice. By making a lot of noise, it is unambiguously shown how many of us there are, and how much we are willing to do to be treated only fairly.

Plus! Picketing is fun! There is music, dancing, food, and all of your friends there along with you. You meet new people from different departments. You connect with others who are each there for their own reason. *These are valuable connections ‚Äì anybody who‚Äôs friends with a grad student knows that it‚Äôs a great thing to have.*

**We are making history out there. There have been, there are, and there always will be many who would like to see the University of California made into a docile, lifeless machine ‚Äì in the words of Mario Savio we must throw our bodies upon the gears, or we risk being enveloped eternally within them. See you on the picket line.**

With the support of /u/lulzcakes we‚Äôre bringing back UC Berkeley‚Äôs chancellor, Carol Christ, for another Ask Me Anything. This is the third year in a row that Chancellor Christ will be participating in an AMA.

Some brief background about Chancellor Christ: She first came to Berkeley fifty years ago to serve as a professor of English, and aside from a stint as president of Smith College from 2002 to 2013 has spent her whole career here. She was appointed Berkeley‚Äôs first female chancellor in 2017, and since then has worked extremely hard to fix the campus‚Äô budget, develop a ten-year strategic plan for the campus, address the housing shortage, build community and improve the campus climate for people of all backgrounds, and more. You can learn more about her [on the chancellor‚Äôs web site](https://chancellor.berkeley.edu/chancellor-christ/biography).

I‚Äôm starting this thread now so you can think of questions and start voting on them, and she‚Äôll begin answering on **Tuesday, Oct. 20 at 4 p.m.**

As has been the case in the past, I'm just here to help the chancellor navigate Reddit‚Äôs non-intuitive interface; she‚Äôll be responding to all questions herself. She‚Äôll be happy to talk about whatever the community is interested in, though she might ask me to circle back on a question if she doesn‚Äôt feel that she can fully answer it.

Ask away!

However, we did not plan for having to evacuate from wild fires, experiencing large earthquakes, having family members in the hospital, having to take over the home responsibility as the main care taker, experiencing more unexpected financial difficulties, having sudden computer and internet problems, etc. \n\nAdditionally, I‚Äôve personally found that classes have gotten harder in the virtual setting. For instance, some of my classes have assigned more work; classes go overtime, professors expect us to carve time to watch additional recorded lectures videos separate from the 5hr/week of live class, and more.

Many students, including myself, are dealing with extreme mental stress, unaccommodating class policies, and family/household difficulties and responsibilities, among many other reasons, most of these cases undocumented and essentially unprovable to qualify as a ""compelling reason"" to advisers. \n\nNot to mention, it is simply unrealistic to ask thousands of these students to be individually making our cases to the advisers, and for the advisers to be taking the enormous responsibility of categorizing these thousands of students\' struggles as ""compelling enough"" or not, in a global situation where everyone is struggling to some extent. \n\nIn fact, I believe more students are like myself and simply don\'t have the time nor will (on top of our heightened workload due to the online instruction format) to be appealing to the advisers that our mental wellbeings are at an all-time low, only to go unnoticed or deemed ""not compelling enough"" of a reason.

With /u/lulzcakes‚Äòs support we‚Äôre bringing back UC Berkeley‚Äôs chancellor, Carol Christ, for another Ask Me Anything session this week. We hosted an AMA with the chancellor [for the first time last October](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/9mhs3p/i_am_carol_christ_chancellor_of_uc_berkeley_ask/), and she loved the format and the opportunity to field so many questions from the campus.

Some brief background about Chancellor Christ: She first came to Berkeley just shy of fifty years ago to serve as a professor of English, and aside from a stint as president of Smith College from 2002 to 2013 has spent her whole career here. She was appointed Berkeley‚Äôs first female chancellor in 2017, and since then has worked extremely hard to fix the campus‚Äô budget, develop a ten-year strategic plan for the campus, address the housing shortage, build community and improve the campus climate for people of all backgrounds, and more. You can learn more about her [on the chancellor‚Äôs web site](https://chancellor.berkeley.edu/chancellor-christ/biography).

I‚Äôm starting this thread now so you can think of questions and start voting on them, and she‚Äôll begin answering on **Wednesday, September 25th at 4 p.m.**

As with last time, I'm just here to help the chancellor navigate Reddit‚Äôs non-intuitive interface; she‚Äôll be responding to all questions herself. She says she‚Äôll be happy to talk about whatever the community is interested in, though if there are areas that she does not know well enough she might ask me to circle back on a question if she doesn‚Äôt feel that she can fully answer it.

Thanks so much and ask away!

Almost 2 years ago, I made a post on here panicking that my dreams of being a software engineer were shattered because I failed to declare the CS major at berkeley. I was extremely depressed and even borderline suicidal during this time in my life; it was truly rock bottom for months and I was the lowest I had ever been in my life. 

Im happy to report that since then, I was able to land a software engineering internship at a decently large company, and have just now signed a new grad SWE offer at a very large tech company (many would categorize it as FAANG/Big-N) in the bay area.  

I honestly don't believe that being a DS major has had any significant or noticeable handicap on my ability to recruit for SWE roles, and I experienced pretty decent response/OA rates, especially after my first internship and once I became a junior.   

I'm not writing this to brag or flex or look for any sort of validation.   

I'm writing this for the many students who are probably going through the same thing that sophomore year me went through: a long stretch of stressful, uncertain, depressing, and agonizing thoughts of self-perceived failure as they become traumatized by the idea that they won't be able to declare the CS major.  

There absolutely still is a future for you in SWE and in the tech industry in general; 3 classes do not determine your ability to shine as a productive and valued software engineer. 

As long as you follow the traditional advice that's been regurgitated a million times all over the place (grind leetcode, do projects, get internships, etc.), you will be absolutely fine as a DS major. 

If I can ease the anxiety, fear, and depression of even one Berkeley student reading this post, then I will consider it a success.","[{'author': 'None', 'body': 'thanks for this it helps', 'score': 81, 'created_utc': 1637640097.0}, {'author': 'Striking-Journalist1', 'body': ""Thank you for the reassurance.

155,hmkg5c,bucciaratimaboi,1003.0,0.98,77,berkeley,"Just about a couple hours ago, the ICE(US Immigration and Customs Enforcement) released a new policy regarding international students. Which basically says if we take 100%[here is a tweet about the policy](https://twitter.com/reichlinmelnick/status/1280207487573069827?s=21)online classes for fall, we cannot stay in the US, even if we have a student visa. This policy is both unreasonable, unrealistic, and extremely xenophobic imo.
     First of all, it is nearly impossible to get an airplane ticket during this time, and even if you managed to find one, they are absurdly expensive (~$7000) More importantly, since the US has so many cases of COVID, countries like Vietnam already banned anyone(including their citizens)from the US to enter their borders.
     Secondly, Some students like myself are from countries that are not suitable for online classes. Most  countries in Asia have huge time differences compared to the US. that means students have to wake up at 2,4 am everyday just to attend classes. Some countries like China blocks US networks, and some underprivileged countries don‚Äôt even have internet access....
    Finally, what even is the point of deporting international students? We are here legally and have done no harm to the economy. We had to pay full tuition for public schools like cal, and so many of us are in huge debt just to study and get a better life....I know that complaining about the government won‚Äôt change anything, but this is just frustrating to the point where I had to rant about it here....I pray that all my fellow international students can stay strong and be united.","[{'author': 'JuniorAct7', 'body': 'It is an incredibly unreasonable and xenophobic policy, but that is the point.

160,pq5am6,bobabull,346.0,0.97,44,berkeley,"One person that had been hanging around my friends tested covid positive. So, just to make sure I was being safe I tested. I tested positive. However, everyone that had been around the positive case tested negative, INCLUDING my unvaccinated roommate. Thinking I had got it from somewhere else, I accepted my fate and moved into isolation housing. However, upon looking at my results, I noticed there was a strange time conflict. I got swabbed at 9:15, yet the swab was timestamped at 10:30. I thought maybe this was a normal occurrence, but after asking my friends, their time stamps were correct. Also thinking back to the covid test earlier in the day, I remembered that it was very disorganized to the point that someone‚Äôs test was sitting right next to mine. After this I decided I wanted to retest, to confirm the results. Upon asking UHS for one, I was denied and told they would not do one because their tests are ‚Äúextremely accurate‚Äù. However, I asked again at isolation and the isolation coordinator said I could retest, so I booked one.

I was notified that morning that another covid positive person would move into the suite with me. Before I realized that I could be a false positive, I was fine with it, however they still wanted to move the person in after I had suspicions about my test. Luckily the person who was positive understood and did not move in. That night I wanted to order a test to see if I was positive or not using an at home test (I know they are not as accurate, but I wanted to see). It arrived and the fifteen minutes passed. Negative.

The next morning I woke up did my lecture then went to test. I took the test and awaited my results in my room at isolation. Negative. At this point I felt like I was being endangered to be kept around covid positive people, so I called UHS to ask them if I could return to class since I tested negative twice, one of which was their own test. They denied my claim and said that they could not confirm their test was a false negative since they claimed yet again their tests are ‚Äúextremely‚Äù accurate. At this point I was furious because I was being forced to be exposed to COVID in isolation while being negative. Then my only other option was to head home.

I got picked up and went home, wearing a mask, just in case the whole drive. Upon my arrival home, I isolated myself in my room. The next morning, I got another at home COVID test and got another negative. Then later that day I went and got a more reliable test (a PCR one). NEGATIVE. 4 negative results later and yet I still cannot return to campus. Now, this is costing me not only gas money to return home and a plane ticket to return, but also access to things that Berkeley only offers in person, such as discussions, club meetings, DeCal lectures, my seminar class, and interviews. Yet, UHS does not care and refuses to let me return to campus.

So now I am stuck at home for two weeks and there is potentially someone out there that is COVID-positive spreading it to everyone they interact with. Yet, UHS refuses to accept that they messed up. I guess four negative tests are not good enough for them.

164,j1rznd,blahblah928,323.0,0.97,83,berkeley,"CS 162 just released their zoom proctoring guidelines and its **17 pages long** (no joke). It follows almost the same policies that 61C was criticized for, including Zoom screen share + crazy phone recordings and recommending us to get popsockets or cut slits in soda boxes, even though staff were ""aware"" of the shitshow in 61C and were going to take steps to avoid it. Frankly, it seems like the course staff doesn't care. And, we have 3 midterms total in this class, so this is going to repeat a lot.

I don't see why I now have to stress over how to position my phone, where I'm going to get a pop socket from, and figure out all the logistical zoom settings and desk setup while having to study for this midterm at the same time. Frankly, it shouldn't be allowed for instructors to impose such excessive policies.

I get that there needs to be ways to combat cheating and I'm fine with some level of proctoring/monitoring/screen sharing/video etc, but the burden of combatting cheating shouldn't be transferred to students to create a film studio in their room to capture everything. Other classes like CS 61A are able to still do some level of Zoom proctoring to combat cheating, while also not contributing even more to student stress

EDIT: The policies are [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sarPFQOpTaN7yq46sILi5pRB2cAF4RvArKO1J3R4IQs/edit?usp=sharing) if anyone wants to read (berkeley email needed)

tl;dr of policies

* On computer (zoom): screen share, video on, audio on, and recorded to the cloud. TAs can also enter our zoom rooms at any moment.
* On phone (also on zoom): ""we \[need to\] see your screen, keyboard, hands, and desk."" Oh also, your phone needs to be high quality enough/close enough to your screen that we can read the text. Which is fundamentally at odds with being far enough to capture a wide enough angle for the first ask.
* Most importantly, the burden of finding a good camera placement is placed on the students, so good luck trying to put your phone in/on your shoe, popsockets, boxes, cereal boxes, tables, etc. (these were all recommended to us) to do this!! The policies were only released less than 72 hrs before the exam so we have little time to rearrange our rooms and make it recordable.
* At the beginning of the test, go up to the camera and video yourself with photo ID, and state your name and SID and stay there for 5 seconds.
* Also they're having us follow these 10+ pages of Zoom settings configuration
* Keep in mind this class has 3 midterms so we're going to be doing this over and over again. I don't see how this is ok. I shouldn't have to record myself in a way that is reminiscent of prison CCTV footage to take a fucking midterm.","[{'author': 'time_lord114', 'body': 'Their proctoring policies make it soo inaccessible. ‚ÄúJust slide a table behind you‚Äù ‚Äî- sorry I don‚Äôt have any extra furniture. ‚ÄúSit on the ground‚Äù ‚Äî I get a headache when I sit on the ground hunching over my test and it‚Äôs definitely not a good position versus sitting at my desk on a chair.

almost all the men but one that ive talked to in this major are either A) extremely condescending B) super cliquey or C) clearly only engaging with you because they want a crumb of coochie. is this just my experience? i mean obviously there must be men in this major that aren't like this, but why havent i found them? 

to point A): am i doing something to make these men assume im an idiot (i'm just... not)? or do they just always talk down to women like that? when i've tried doing hw or something with guys and i'm having trouble, i'll ask specific questions and they'll respond by explaining everything since the beginning of time (like literally ""so, do you know what a tree structure is?"") as if I don't know. i once had this happen, cut him off to tell him ""you don't need to explain that to me, i just asked _______ about this specific problem"" and he said, word for word, ""see! you're so smart! don't sell yourself short."" im sorry WHAT

to point B): i switched majors late and most of my friends i met in early CS classes are just minoring, so they're not taking all of the classes or are on a different schedule than me. sooo ive been doing all my projects, hw, and lab alone since 61A. every time classes start i try to make friends but all the guys are so cliquey and there aren't many women :(((( its just so intimidating. 

and to point C): GOD its the grossest grossest feeling to think you've found someone normal to be your lab partner just for them to start hitting on you and being creepy. i had an experience with a guy i met at a project party who wouldn't stop texting me and kept asking why i wasn't replying and accused me of making up excuses to ignore him soooooo kinda nervous to give any guy my number after that. 


basically, its super tiring being a girl in this major. it might be subtle but it gets exhausting trying to navigate a male dominated space. if anyone has tips on how to make it out here, let me know. i'd love to hear perspectives from people who think differently, to see if maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way.

Yes, this includes rants: especially for a time like this, the voicing of our frustrations and problems is important. However, I frequently notice **""toxic self-deprecation""** creeping into the posts. Imagine them as the opposite of humble-bragging: subtly veiled posts that brings others down with them.

For example, imagine a post with the following contents: ""I'm a Sophomore and I haven't secured a summer internship yet... literally all of my friends have gotten an internship and I feel so behind... I feel like I don't deserve to be in \[major\]...""

This commonly seen post implies the following ideas:

1. You are behind if you don't have an internship in Sophomore year. Even worse if you are a Junior and beyond.
2. It is normal for people to have internships. You are the oddity otherwise.
3. If you don't have an internship, you aren't good enough for your major.

It doesn't matter if the intent of the author was to simply ""vent""; the fact that someone expressed these sentiments exacerbate toxic (and frequently false) ideas that are associated with the stress-cooker environment in Berkeley.

I think it is time we introduce a **nuanced rule against toxic self-deprecation.** We are seeing that they do more harm than good in this community.

Berkeley additionally has problems where there are very few good experiences and way too many bad, and thus gives more data for people to believe what they\'re seeing online. \n\nThe purpose of this post is to include nuance for you to consider, in comparison to OP\'s proposed solution.\n\n-------\n\nThere\'s two angles here that I\'d like to cover - public image with positive/negative comments, and the monstrous self-fulfilling prophecy that online communities foster. \n\n[Part 1: Online]\n\nLet\'s start with the latter. I don\'t think it\'s always been this way - it\'s really only been in the last ~5 years that we\'ve really begun to see such a pervasive negative attitude from Berkeley, and it\'s source began in 2016 with UC Berkeley Memes for Edgy Teens on FB.[1]\n\nThe initial unfortunate issue is that the nature of such a page is inherent negativity. The funniest memes have always been about student struggles. What makes a meme page so influential though is that it leads to normalization of said topics, which then leads to propagation to the entire campus community. \n\nThe upside is that now that those of us who used to silently struggle now feel comfortable sharing - the downside is that ""struggling"" is now an avenue for social acceptance. And that becomes the self fulfilling prophecy - by having a culture of ""everyone is unhappy and struggles""[2] be the online face of the school, people will see that and unconsciously guide in that direction. \n\nIt\'s also a large chunk of the total ""Berkeley experience"" time that people experience. If you think about the # of hours spent on experiences physically on campus, vs online experiences about Berkeley, you\'ve probably spent a huge proportion of that time online, deriving a lot of what you think about Berkeley from your news feed and reddit. It also directs your expectations - if you expect to find negative things, you\'re going to be noticing more negative things.\n\n[Part 2: Offline]\n\nThe second topic is about the chunk of time that you do spend on campus - and here, Berkeley does itself NO favors. The subjective experience is, in short, bad. Our freshmen year experience is built on the backs of overcrowded dorms, shitty dining hall foods, sudden immersion in the perception of an unsafe Southside environment, and hypercompetitive courses you can barely Phase I for. We also get kicked out in year 2 because of lack of space in the dorms, and get to explore extremely high prices for anything ranging from average quality singles with mold, to a partitioned living room, both costing $1k+. The subjective experience is of a campus that feels like it doesn\'t care.\n\nWe don\'t have enough positive experiences[3], and we have too many negative experiences, of which are also made disproportionately weighted due to internet perceptions. I\'ll straight up say it, our school needs to do better. If there\'s a way to quantify the financial loss caused by the network effect (happening right now) of people believing Berkeley is not a great school, then I\'m sure they\'d get off their asses and reallocate to make the Berkeley experience better. But as it is right now, it\'s a nebulous thing that the campus is probably aware is a bad thing, but just aren\'t aware of how seriously bad.\n\n[for Reddit]\n\nImplementing rules against toxic self-deprecation does not solve the source of the toxicity, it just blocks its expression without addressing its sources. And the absence of self-deprecating posts doesn\'t mean we\'re going to get better ones to replace them on reddit, for the same (inverse) reasons.\n\nWith all that said, it\'s a complicated problem, and if you think you can implement this level of nuance into a subreddit mod rule and enforce it properly, then I\'ll eat my diploma. \n\n-----\n\n[1] I bring up UCBMFET because there is a close overlap in sentiment/community by how frequently FB posts are crossposted here, and vice versa. \n\n[2] As we\'ve seen with literally anything related to Trump, it doesn\'t even need to be a true statement to be influential, it just needs to be prevalent. Fixing the meme page PR problem is on the same magnitude as fixing the MAGA/flat Earther problem, of which no one has answers to. Suppression doesn\'t work.\n\n[3] I\'ve made it a personal rule not to judge Berkeley until I graduate, to ensure I\'ve experienced everything before I decide if I liked it here or not.

I quit and enjoyed the rest of my semester, joined a service organization (Alpha Phi Omega), and graduated from Haas undergrad anyway.

176,g9avi4,airbearsover9000,387.0,0.98,31,berkeley,"Hi all. I'm a senior here. I'm gonna jump right in, as for why you should read this, it's 10 minutes now that will save you for years later. Every single one is important (not in particular order). **This is by far the most important topic for improving your grades.**

I've left the meta summary below. I suggest you read it but tldr there will be many parts. This is applicable to CS, EECS, and 95% to other technical majors. Other parts (that apply to everyone in any major) might come depending on reception.

**PRACTICE** **EXAMS:**

\- Practice exams are the absolute HOLY GRAIL to doing well on tests here.

1. **This is surprising but I usually spend about 3 hours correcting my exam**. If there is one takeaway here it should be this. You need to understand in absolute full detail every question you got wrong.
2. **You should be redoing those problems (without the solutions) as you mark them wrong**. Sometimes it's inevitable but if you check the solution, only lower the solution pdf up until the part you get stuck, masking the rest of the problem. Then redo the problem from there.
3. **Correct your practice exams in colored pen**. Everything in a different colored pen. It makes you accountable for what you didn't know when you look back to review and/or to make your cheat sheet. It also marks a clear distinction on exams so that you know exactly what you didn't know. I've personally also found value out of colored mechanical pencils.
4. **Piazza is your friend.** You should be searching piazza for those questions you got wrong and couldn't understand why. Let's say it was Fall 2018 q2 part ii. There's likely a post or comment about it on the Fall 2018 midterm thread. If not search ""Fall 2018"" and scan through previous student posts. If not, make your own post with ""Fall 2018 q2 part ii"" as the title and screenshot the solution and your question. An **instructor or gsi will almost always have a more tailored explanation** in a way you can understand. I might've gotten a little in-depth here but nevertheless.
5. **OH is your friend.** You really cannot go wrong here if you have the time for it. Usually, there will be midterm specific OH too. It's very valuable to attend these not only to ask, but also hear other student's questions and answers. It's not critical for every exam, but those you need special help on. Also if you have time.
6. **Class discussion slides/notes are your friend.** As you correct your exam. There is a lot of value here as you usually end up not only clarifying things, but also finding the info you had no idea that you didn't know (especially on notes/discussion slides).
7. **Lecture should reinforce the basic concepts, but won't be a catchall**. You can't just rewatch lectures and expect it to work miracles. Granted rewatching lectures (especially the old ones) helps remind you of things you've forgotten. But don't expect it to do all the work.
8. When correcting problems, **even if you don't understand one small step in the solution, you still need to fully understand it. You should refer back to the following #4-#7 resources**.
9. **I print all my exams**. This is actually a really make or break thing. **It really helps in the visual sense. Everything's on the same page, problem statements, your work, and your corrections.** It gives you workspace for the problems. It's easy to just pick up and do it and work anywhere. Anything that makes taking the exams easier helps
10. **Do 2 exams for bare minimum practice, 3 is decent but still a little under, 4 is the target sweet spot, 4+ if you're still getting a lot of things wrong**. If you're correcting the way I said above it should be more and more difficult to consistently get the same concepts wrong. Your mentality should be it's ok to get questions wrong, and even good. Although it stings, every question you get wrong here is a mistake you won't make on the exam.
11. For questions where you **missed something in the problem statement, circle it** in colored pen on the exam.
12. Usually **questions you get wrong have some sort of takeaway concept** that you can repeat to yourself. It's usually like less than a sentence long. Write it down in colored pen on your exam and internalize it.
13. **Time your exams.** On the first or the second, it's ok to not do so because you might be learning the problem types as you go along, but on the third or fourth this is a must. It will let you know if you need to quicken your pace as you take them.
14. **Headstuck is an issue**. Don't hesitate to temporarily skip problems and come back to them. This is a general test taking tip but very very applicable. A stuck problem will make you feel shitty. I've had situations where I spend 30 minutes staring at a problem and getting headstuck, didn't even realize 30 minutes went by without any progress. Your head isn't clear at the moment. If you learn to pick up on signs when you're headstuck you can skip problems quicker.
15. Going off of the last number, **problem types you usually get headstuck on practice exam #3 and #4 are problems you'll want to do last** on a real test. You'll usually be able to identify those problem types when you get to the real exam, **scan through it quickly and skip it when you get to it.**
16. **Space out taking your practice exams at least 1 per day, leading up to the exam**. Aka if exam is April 29 and there are 4 exams available, I would start on April 25. Exams for the classes you dislike will make you miserable. This is a way of coping with that misery. Also, your brain has time to digest what it learned from the last day and apply it.
17. **Cheat sheet**. I literally wrote down practice problems I got wrong and my corrected solution of it. This really helped, didn't have the time to fully reinforce that specific problem type (looking at you cs70). Granted, there are many ways to make one and this might not be your style.
18. **Ultimately, exam grades are what you put into them.** if you follow the above I believe your ROI on your time will increase, but you still need to put in the time. I believe school and grades in general is 99% a measure of work ethic. It can always be improved if you want it enough.
19. **Exam Resources**. Some places to look

* course website
* tbp/ekn
* piazza. Sometimes instructors will have prepared a practice exam/packet posted on piazza.
* courshero (search reddit, there are services that give you 1-2 dollar unlocks).
* Substitute discussion problems if you can't find exam problems.

College really throws you into a loop and I think that by making this series (hopefully with 6-7 parts planned depending on feedback) I can help some of freshly admitted into Cal or those who are struggling with academics here.

I did not come here and immediately ace all my classes, I was a B student first year. You can get better.

These parts will go over the things that took me many years it took to learn to get 4.0 semesters here.  I'm studying EECS. All of what I say here applies to CS (it's basically the same thing), and 95% to other technical majors/classes.

Other majors/classes may not find the above directly applicable, I'm sorry I can't specialize the post for you but it's not in my experience. However, I plan to make more posts (especially those about registration) which are applicable to everyone. [Here's some of the topics I might cover](https://imgur.com/a/xrkqyjt)

I have about 14 topics I want to cover in detail. This post was supposed to cover 3 but I only got to 1. Please let me know if it's too in-depth. I'd appreciate any feedback. If there is one thing I want to restress though is, **this was by far the most important topic for improving your grades.**

Wow, I spent way longer on this than I expected. I really hope this helps even 1 person. It's never the same learning from another person's mistakes, but you'll definitely run into your own specialized challenges and adapt.

I have seen many people say that they were not going to interact with Matt Walsh‚Äôs team when they came to Berkeley. Which is undoubtedly the best route of action for his trip. 

However, knowing that this is Berkeley‚Ä¶ someone will definitely want to poke the bear. (sorry Oski)

I think this video illustrates and educates anyone new to debate pundits (when in Rome, aka when on Berkeley Reddit post a twitch streamer video.) [https://youtu.be/SgJJKZYey-o?t=300](https://youtu.be/SgJJKZYey-o?t=300)  to be honest just watch 5:00-6:27. TLDR: The video illustrates that even a well-versed professor cannot change his opinion. Matt is just looking for you to stumble or say something he can spin. He is trying to give you topics and things to say and edit giving him the upper hand. 

What to do if you are approached or see someone being approached by an individual on Matt Walsh's team? 

Disney music is the answer‚Ä¶ Disney has some of the best lawyers and generally has a monopoly on whether a video is taken down or not. Disney with the amount of rainbow capitalism it has produced throughout the past couple of years sure as hell will not want to be affiliated with Matt Walsh. So, If Disney music is present when Matt Walsh is trying to interview any student he will not be able to post or make content out of his Berkeley trip. 

Other ways to interact if you feel the urge to (because regardless some students will still interact) is dm emailing or trying to spam the team so they cannot have much communication with a general audience. Let's give Matt Walsh a Berkeley welcome and ask him the runtime of heap sort, how to navigate Dwinelle, or something classic like ‚ÄúI saw Matt Walsh at the RSF.. how do I ask him out, uwu.‚Äù

Regardless, not engaging is the best way to handle his visit. Matt Walsh is here to make his paycheck. He is not here to take you seriously, he is going to take clips of us and turn them into content. Sorry, no one is going to ‚Äùmagically‚Äù change his mind, but we can surely leave him with no content to profit off of.

So, take care of yourself and check in with your trans friends.

If you have a complicated ass question that requires an answer from the University Help Desk or the IT department, don't ask it here. Cal may have the number #1 EECS program in the world, but they don't hire any Cal graduates. It's an open secret that all of Cal's websites/portals are run by Devry graduates.

To answer some of the most commonly asked questions by newly accepted students.

1. **Housing**: There isn't any. Unless you can pay 1800 a month for student housing OR you can live in an illegal unit, most likely under a crawl space, for $900 a month.

2. **Safety**: There isn't any. If you're walking outside and it's dark, you may get robbed at gunpoint. Always carry a decoy wallet and always wear running shoes.

3. **Picking Schools**: So you got into UCLA (barf), UCSD (hella barf), and Cal (Fuck Yea). Which do you pick? If you have to ask that question then go to somewhere else.

4. **Workload**: Is Cal hard? You think getting into Cal was hard? Try graduating. There is a reason why rich parents pay for their kids to get into Stanfurd. They have grade inflation, Cal has grade deflation. Basically, at most elite universities they hand out A's just for showing up to class with your clothes on. At Cal, most of your grades are determined by your GSI. GSI's are hella jealous of Cal undergrads because GSIs had to go to an inferior university for their undergrad. They'll give you a B and act like they're being super generous.

5. **Clubs**: The only clubs you'll be joining are called study groups. This isn't high school. You can't join three clubs and still get A's. At Cal, for each club you join you'll lose a full letter grade. 

6. **GPA**: ""Can I maintain a 4.0 GPA at Cal?"" LOL. Anything above a 3.5 is a fucking miracle. We've got savants going to school here that are barely breaking a 3.5.

In conclusion, it's going to be a shitstorm. Cal will swallow the weak ones whole and drop you like a turd. Only the strong or the mentally disturbed can withstand the Cal experience. And Fuck Stanfurd.

While I adhered to this advice for the past couple years, it has never helped me as much as it does now. Remote learning is not for me, and I am guessing a lot of you are in the same boat. Focusing is hard, zoom fatigue is real, and the grading is horrific. I have disappointed myself more than I ever had this last year, and it could have been extremely crippling, quite honestly it is. However, keeping in mind that you cannot change the past, only learn from it to improve in the future is powerful.

Dwelling on your failures will only hinder you from succeeding going forward. Keep this in mind. Allow yourself to be sad, angry even, remember the feeling, then move on and never cry over it again. This may sound obvious, but it is so difficult to do.

Why the fuck do people want People‚Äôs Park to keep existing, and why doesn‚Äôt the university do something about the crime near campus? It seems like every other day I get an alert reading that a violent crime or robbery has occurred near campus. This is bizarre for a college campus, yet I‚Äôm never surprised when I hear about an armed robbery or a blunt trauma attack on campus, typically in the evening. Okay, no cops, fine, whatever, but goddamn it do something about these fucking attacks. 

If you want people‚Äôs park to keep existing or cops entirely off campus, I encourage you to take a stroll near people‚Äôs park or on the perimeter of campus around 2 am. Get robbed. I assume your opinion on the matter would change.

Backstory: I was walking on campus today and almost fucking robbed by a man who had a gun, who asked me to ‚Äúcome over [to him]‚Äù or else. Luckily, I could tell the gun was a fake and ran (don‚Äôt try that unless you know, and even if so, don‚Äôt). I went to campus police and they seemed so fucking lax about it. This needs to stop now. If anyone is interested I would absolutely love to protest the lack of safety around campus. If you‚Äôve made it this far, thanks.

TLDR: Need more campus security. Homeless don‚Äôt belong on or near campus. If you‚Äôre down with People‚Äôs Park I hope you get robbed. If you‚Äôre down with Peoples Park and especially if you protest for it  you can eat a pulsating, juicy horse cock.

EDITüñï: I hope the homeless at people‚Äôs park are removed and placed within mental health facilities where applicable and those of good mental standing are to be offered decently payed public work jobs, Berkeley streets look like shit. Then bulldoze the park and erect a massive dormitory there, there is also a housing crisis. God The People‚Äôs Park defenders are so fucking stupid it makes my skin melt.

HOWEVER, as long as you\'re above a 3.0 you can generally make a case for yourself if you put the work in to go *somewhere* (it won\'t be harvard but it\'ll be something). above 3.5 is generally solid (again, maybe not harvard, but also not like an immediate no from harvard). professional schools have gotten very picky lately so 3.8 is generally the truly safe zone (but also, when it comes to modern post-college school, there is no such thing as a safe zone, people with 4.0s still get rejected). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nwhen professors say grades aren\'t important, they usually want to dissuade two

we set syllabi at the beginning of the term with very clear guidlines on what you have to do to get an A. but also, As are not earned just by putting in effort. sometimes people work incredibly hard but things just don\'t click until a year later. but there\'s nothing wrong with getting a B. if you\'re consistently getting Cs or lower, that is usually a sign that you\'re either not studying properly, or that you\'re just not in the right subject. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nas for studying towards tests... honestly if i cared about my students grades on tests i would just give them all the reading material and practice exams and fuck off until exam time. but the point of education is to create a dialogue. we want to get people excited about the subject. a lot of professors at big research institutions only teach because it\'s required, but they\'re still only in that position because of a deep love for the subject. none of us remember what grades we got in our undergrad courses, but i

are allowed to do. but at the end of the day, if you get a bad grade and lose your scholarship, it\'s most likely your fault. if you have such a scholarship it means you can get good grades. it also means you should know how to pick your battles. if you suck at math but decide to take abstract algebra anyways, that\'s on you. if you realize after a month that the class is too much to keep up with on top of your other commitments and don\'t drop, that\'s on you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nlife ain\'t meant to be easy. there are many unjust systems in the world, but if you made it to berkeley, you should have enough wits about you to figure out how to roll with the punches. \n\n&#x200B;\n\noh also professors aren\'t judged by their distributions except in large lectures. and that\'s only because it\'s pretty much impossible for a room of 300 undergrads of various backgrounds and persuasions to all get an A in say CS61B or MATH1B. it just would never happen and if it does it means either those

198,yp4k0h,Spiritof454,394.0,0.99,63,berkeley,"I‚Äôve seen a few posts on this sub asking questions about the plan for GSIs and postdocs to begin a strike on November 14th. Our union, UAW 2865, voted to authorize a strike in response to ‚Äúunfair labor practices.‚Äù What this means for undergrads is that there is a chance that discussion sections and likely many main lectures will be cancelled during the strike. The extent to which grading will be disrupted will vary substantially by course and GSI/postdoc.

Personally, I plan on getting as much grading done prior to the potential strike and continuing to grade throughout, but not posting said grades. This is to both withhold my labor in line with the goal of forcing UC admin to come to the bargaining table, but also to ensure that the backlog of work will not be insurmountable. We have also agreed to not answer emails from students involving questions for any course material or issues. If you need to get into contact with your GSI on some sort of issue, your best bet is to contact the instructor of record for the course (i.e., the professor). 

I want to make this abundantly clear; we do not want to go on strike. It disrupts our own projects and makes teaching and grading post-strike more difficult. Most of us actually enjoy teaching and care about the success and well-being of undergrad students. I am legitimately sorry for any disruptions or difficulties that may arise from the strike.
If you are so inclined, you can support your GSIs in several ways. First, you can contact GSIs abd professors and express your support for the action. You can also contact the deans or departmental heads relevant to your coursework. Additionally, you can take time to picket with GSIs if you have the time. Finally, the most effective form of support is a boycott of classes/lectures. Unfortunately, this is NOT protected behavior. You may face consequences from doing this, although I do think this is highly unlikely. It will require a certain amount of coordination with your classmates. 

We are planning on undertaking this strike because many of us find it difficult to make ends meet. Although our jobs are strictly speaking only ‚Äúhalf time,‚Äù or 20 hours a week. We have substantial obligations for coursework and unpaid overtime. In effect, the compensation for our labor would be sufficient if it were the only thing we have to do, but it is absolutely not. Higher pay also means that we have less financial pressures and makes it easier for us to teach coursework. This holds especially true for GSIs and postdocs with children, who ideally will receive more expansive childcare benefits. 
I will be checking this post periodically in order to answer questions from yall in the comments. If you have concerns about what the strike may mean for you, please DM me or reply and I‚Äôd be more than happy to speak to those concerns.

One never imagines they would be present at the grounds of a shooting; let alone a school shooting. And yet death, in America, looms in the edifices of books; children worry whether they will be safe in the haven of their classrooms, and now, for those of us who chose to stay in Doe just a little while longer that night, were faced with a sense of an impending end.

What better place than to look up at the magnificently rounded marble ceiling of Doe and wonder ‚Äúis this where it ends for me? For my peers who moments ago were engaged in such silent diligence that the slightest crumble of a chip bag would lend a leering gaze?‚Äù

In an instant, a sound which can‚Äìunbeknownst to us‚Äìbe described as balloon-like pops dancing with the shrieks of youthful exuberance, began to creep through the open windows of Doe. Slowly, a blanket of overwhelming silence lurched into the throats of everyone in the hall as they carefully parsed out the aural message transmitted from the Glade. As some befuddled with their headphones, others surveyed the room to see the anxiously increased stuffing of laptops and headphones into bags until‚Äìlike a wave that finally knocks one to their feet‚Äì panic showed its infectious face. We furiously stuffed our bags and ran like the other¬† ants do after one is smashed in any direction imaginable hoping that where our bodies desperately lurched us towards was an exit. Some broke their way through a windowed door single file and wagered whether the 15 foot jump from the balcony was worth their life; others barricaded the doors in solidarity hoping to at least hold out for help to arrive. And finally, for those poor souls who found themselves caught between wanting to run and wanting to hide; a moment of clarity cut through calamity.¬†

‚ÄúIt was a club.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúThey were playing a game popping balloons on the Glade‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúHow fucking dumb?‚Äù

Word trickled into the hall; those souls who found themselves on the balcony marched back in. Some returned to their studies immediately, others clasped their hands over their faces grateful to be able to draw another breath; it wasn‚Äôt for quite some time that the adrenaline filled ceilings began to collapse. As the police began to march through the halls, AR‚Äôs in hand, following the procedural clearing of balconies and corridors I was gripped by the bizarre scenario we were just in. Was it really the case that on February 18th a couple of opaquely cheerful screams and balloons were enough to pierce an elephant of American trauma?¬†","[{'author': 'einschluss', 'body': 'written by a true english major', 'score': 196, 'created_utc': 1645248568.0}, {'author': 'Desperate_Ad_2851', 'body': 'I like Cheetosüëçüèº.', 'score': 31, 'created_utc': 1645251851.0}, {'author': 'jh451911', 'body': 'rip does windows üôè', 'score': 9, 'created_utc': 1645295763.0}, {'author': 'sickasspanda', 'body': 'Chills.', 'score': 17, 'created_utc': 1645252716.0}, {'author': 'unclewalty', 'body': 'And still misused ‚Äúbefuddled.‚Äù So yes‚Äî a true English major.', 'score': 26, 'created_utc': 1645283195.0}, {'author': 'Recent_Muscle1826', 'body': 'We Stan English major', 'score': 44, 'created_utc': 1645248928.0}, {'author': 'TheOneAltAccount', 'body': 'LITERALLY', 'score': 13, 'created_utc': 1645249845.0}, {'author': 'DragoSphere', 'body': ""Bemused is another classic.

Gabbie sharp made extremely racist, bigoted, hateful, and violent comments about other people, both white, mixed, and Asian, and yet has received 0 pushback against what she‚Äôs done.

The daily cal, a newspaper infamous for jumping as fast as possible on any racist story or anything controversial, has failed to comment on the issue. The absolute [joke](https://www.dailycal.org/2021/09/24/asuc-rejects-judicial-candidate-hears-comment-on-senators-tweets/) of an article that they wrote focuses on the Asuc‚Äôs rejection of a candidate, and mentions Gabbie‚Äôs offensive tweets in one sentence. This is Ofcourse in contrast to their [extremely long and well detailed](https://www.dailycal.org/2021/03/08/independent-candidate-gabrielle-sharp-runs-for-asuc-senate/) article about her running.

Not only is this extremely disingenuous, but is straight up hypocrisy, as there are a plethora of examples of the daily cal not waiting a single hour to not jump on a story of this magnitude, the only difference here being is who‚Äôs commuting the racist act and who it‚Äôs targeted against.

Furthermore, the absolute silence from asuc and campus is so disgusting. Completely anti ethical to the Berkeley message of inclusivity, harboring safe spaces for everyone, and being against hate speech. For a campus that is so active against such events, the silence is deafening and frankly extremely insulting.

This issue must not pass. If we allow them to get away with this, simply because the person committing the racist acts and the group they‚Äôre targeting doesn‚Äôt fit the progressive agenda, that it can be completely covered up and ignored is an insult not just to the Berkeley institution as a whole, but to the rest of its students and it‚Äôs promises of a safe campus. 

I saw we organize a protest, this Friday between 2-4 pm, holding up signs, just like other groups on campus love to do on progressive issues, and demand that Berkeley directly intervenes and recalls Gabbie, in addition to an asuc investigation onto why they completely ignored the situation and attempted to hide it by cutting office hours short. In addition, a formal investigation into the daily cal on why they can target other people and write their full names and ruin their reputation when they do a fraction of what Gabbie has done, but Gabbie herself did not get the same treatment, either because of her connections to the daily cal, or because of their disingenuous and frankly disgusting selective journalism.

As one of the main organizers for the recall effort, I must confess that I‚Äôve seen this movement start from a single thread on Reddit and transform into a school-wide phenomenon. While I think it‚Äôs great that so many people are disgusted by Senator Sharp‚Äôs public comments, and that we are holding an elected official accountable, we need to remember the course of action is to simply remove Gabbi Sharp from office.

Let‚Äôs remind ourselves that Gabbi Sharp has 1st amendment rights just like the rest of us and has the capability to say whatever she pleases (even hate speech) other than inciting imminent violence. Let‚Äôs also remember that Gabbi Sharp is a student who takes courses here and walks around on-campus. It is absolutely necessary that we respect her ability to feel safe on-campus and NOT confront her outside of ASUC meetings. Despite how bigoted and hateful she can be, Gabbi is still a person who attends school here and is owed decency.

To be clear: Any bullying, harassing, or confronting Gabbi Sharp is completely unacceptable and not representative of the recall movement. The only capacity in which any of us should engage Gabbi is during a public ASUC meeting or during the recall election. 

The idea is simple: We don‚Äôt stand for Gabbi‚Äôs ideals, and we are going to conduct a recall. Nothing more, nothing less.

I go outside this afternoon to see the police surrounding his area. My first thought was wtf are they doing there? He‚Äôs the nicest guy, keeps the area neat, and is just trying to keep going. 

Next thing I see is a stretcher leaving with a tarp pulled over a body. The coroners van then leaves, then the cops are left picking up his belongings.

It is planning another $20 billion dollars in the largest ever budget dedicated to homelessness in history over the next few years as well. A huge problem is that this money is being wasted and not easily held accountable for how its being used. There still isn\'t a transparent and centrally coordinated strategy for really reducing homelessness across the board. The money flows into housing projects or relief programs that are barely making a dent in the issue. The problem could be not enough money sure, but a lot of it is also how that money is used. \n\nThe issue is even more complicated by the fact that there is a complex web of policy, economic, and social factors that contribute to both reinforcing the massive problem of increasing homelessness. \n\n- the tech economy makes a lot of money but the share of that wealth is being centralized to a smaller number of people. tech companies make their executives and employees rich by comparison to the rest of the country which massively raises housing costs and living costs but doesn\'t raise wages as quickly for non tech workers.\n\n- housing projects for low income or homelessness are subject to NIMBY effects. Because of the exorbitant housing prices, many owners are very sensitive about multi-family homes or just high density residential properties being built in their neighborhoods that could reduce those prices. It\'s not just greedy, imagine you\'re someone who has a couple of million dollars in mortgage payments to cover and you worked hard to achieve that...would you want anything to potentially reduce the value of your house? This results in building any sort of affordable high density apartments very hard to get approved from local government agencies. Some developers say it can take years just to get approved...\n\n- the lack of legal enforcement. Due to recent changes to remove jail time or any criminal charges for a large number of street crimes like drug possession, vandalism, trespassing, burglary, etc. Crime is increasing and there\'s very few things that can get a homeless person off the street. Decriminalization of drug possession may seem humane, but it also results in many dealers preying on the homeless population by selling snd getting them addicted. This also contributes to the massive mental health issues that many homeless people experience.... which then prevent them from recovering and getting back on their feet or even taking proper advantage of the relief programs...\n\n- the climate is very warm and survivable year round. people can literally live outside most of the year without too much fear from the elements. In that regard it\'s very attractive to homeless people to come here or stay here.\n\nI mean what do you do? Do you raise taxes? We already have some of the highest taxes in the country. Force new housing developments? Depending on where you live very unpopular with homeowners. Try to get people into rehab or relief programs? Drugs and mental illness. Tougher enforcement of drug related crimes? Lots of progressives will oppose that....

220,l911r5,Reasonable-Basil-237,532.0,0.96,52,berkeley,"Hi. I just wanted to come here and talk about how quickly Covid is spreading in the dorms right now. Last semester, it wasn‚Äôt this bad. Yes, towards the end (specifically after Thanksgiving when people travelled back and forth) cases went up, but I find it completely ridiculous that everyone decided to go out to parties the minute they stepped foot on campus. No one minded the self sequester period, and everyone was out and about, going to frat parties, throwing parties in the units, etc.
On top of that, I‚Äôve heard these exact people say ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre coming to Berkeley during Covid, you already are risking it so might as well party‚Äù and ‚Äúif you‚Äôre here and not going out you‚Äôre just stupid as fuck, and probably anti social.‚Äù
This is not okay you guys. You don‚Äôt know anyone‚Äôs situation, their family life, financial status, etc. Shaming people for wearing a mask or any of that is absolutely ridiculous. 
Foothill is basically at full capacity, and people are getting contact traced but then are just told to quarantine in their room, but then they go out still. There are people who are worried they may have been exposed, but then you see them out and about on social media. 
Then there are those who use mental health as a reason to excuse their behavior. Like dude... you are the exact person who didn‚Äôt shut into your house during the summer, was always out, never had a moment alone, and you‚Äôre using your mental health as an excuse? Sit your privileged ass down and realize the outcomes of your actions. 
You being shut in your room for a week should not cause your mental health to deteriorate as much as you say it does. If that actually does happen, then why in the world are you even here? How did your parents even send you here, knowing your mental health would suffer since you‚Äôre stuck in your dorm room? Did they know you were going to be going out and selfishly partying and never wearing a mask? Or are they not going to take responsibility for sending their self absorbed, attention hungry child to college only for them to spread Covid to everyone? 

Lastly... for gods sake... please stop your little social justice warrior act. Seeing you post your pretty little info graphics about how bad Covid is, etc, makes you the biggest hypocrite of all.

Math 54 is joint ran by two professors, Kelli Talaska (she/her) and Katrin Wehrheim (they/them). We can go to either lecture, sections for either instructor, etc, etc.

Prof. Talaska had been feeling ill for a while now, in large part from trying to catch up with all the grading for her Math 10B class last semester which had fallen behind because of the strike, so she hadn't really put in the work into this semester's Math 54 class that Prof. Wehrheim was expecting from a jointly-run class which put immense stress on them from having to run everything by themselves for the past few weeks.

Prof. Talaska decided last week that it was probably best that she stop instructing the class for the aforementioned health reasons, which left Prof. Wehrheim with the job of teaching all 1000+ students which they obviously couldn't do, despite the math department's push for it.

The department also pushed for Prof. Wehrheim to instead teach alongside the (undecided) replacement instructor for Prof. Talaska, but given the current structure of the course (lectures and section are all group work essentially, worksheets are used daily and upload to a Drive folder, etc.), so Prof. Wehrheim decided that it wouldn't work out and that a new instructor would be completely out of the loop given how the class is currently being ran, so after thinking about it with family and friends over the weekend, they decided to take a leave too.

As such, we don't really know the future of this class, Prof. Wehrheim said it's unlikely to be cancelled, but that if we get new professors, neither we nor they have any idea how the class will be run, but Prof. Wehrheim insists we should fight for things that the class has already promised us and were outlined during Week 1 in the syllabus, as is stated by University policy (take home quizzes, projects instead of midterm/final exams etc), and so that's where things stand at the moment for the class. The GSIs seem committed to helping us and for that I'm really thankful, but it really is just uncertainty all around for them, and for us 1000+ students currently enrolled in the class.","[{'author': 'SV3327', 'body': 'Kelli‚Äôs medical issues caught up, it sucks.', 'score': 102, 'created_utc': 1675200035.0}, {'author': 'blueberry0929', 'body': 'We Need Alexander Paulin', 'score': 48, 'created_utc': 1675239655.0}, {'author': 'gunsHOT2020', 'body': '#Number 1 public university', 'score': 176, 'created_utc': 1675199079.0}, {'author': 'aarush3002', 'body': 'damn', 'score': 24, 'created_utc': 1675198608.0}, {'author': 'Prestigious_Plains', 'body': 'Two professors with some of the worst ratings I‚Äôve ever seen come together to joint teach with a teaching plan even GSIs agree is ridiculous and then decide to quit because they realize it creates way too much unnecessary work for literally everyone involved.

230,gexkza,None,550.0,0.92,41,berkeley,"Let me say that I believe CS majors deserve to live happy fulfilled lives like anyone else. However, I do think there are some genuine issues within the community.

At Berkeley, I was constantly told that not wanting to be a CS major or not enjoying CS classes was CSphobic. A non-CS major not wanting to take CS70 is CSphobic, apparently.

It feels like I am being strong-armed into being a CS major, and if I don‚Äôt than I am some horrible awful bigot. It seems like a constant threat from CS majors, if you don‚Äôt 100% agree with them then you are obviously just a CSphobic bigot.

I have a sister who's a CS major, who switched from data science. She is exactly like the other people on r/ProgrammerHumor. My sister wants to be a caricature of a programmer and doesn‚Äôt actually care about the plight of CS majors. It's not just her, but a large majority of people who switch to CS are like this.

Pointing out that CS majors and other majors ARE different with different experiences is viewed as evil. Are we really going to ignore the fact that CS usually take grade-deflated classes, have intense competition, have shitty advising, etc? How is it wrong to call out these differences? It feels like some CS majors think the major is something to try on.

The whole CS program solidifies stereotypes in majors in a really horrible way. What does it mean to ‚Äúfeel like a programmer‚Äù? Just because you don't shower and spend 23 hours a day on discord doesn't make you a CS major. I loved Scratch and Raspberry Pis as a child, it didn‚Äôt make me a CS major. It just reinforces the notions of major stereotypes. It‚Äôs offensive when I hear CS majors say they love to do ‚ÄúCS things‚Äù like cry about Sahai, get insulted on StackOverflow, not talk to women, etc etc

Pointing any of these out will get you labeled a CSphobe, bigot, humanities major, etc etc etc

Berkeley is ultra CS-centered and thus I am constantly being spoon fed CS rhetoric. Programmers pride themselves on being tolerant and open to discussion, yet that seems to be quite false.","[{'author': 'Xechwill', 'body': 'I would say a+ copypasta OP, but it‚Äôs about CS, so B+ no bin shift copypasta OP', 'score': 250, 'created_utc': 1588819890.0}, {'author': 'None', 'body': '[oregano](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/gepv9r/at_berkeley_i_felt_like_people_were_constantly/?ref=share&ref_source=link)', 'score': 97, 'created_utc': 1588816776.0}, {'author': 'None', 'body': '[deleted]', 'score': 81, 'created_utc': 1588819782.0}, {'author': 'FlufferzPupperz', 'body': 'Genuinely can‚Äôt tell if this is troll\n\nEdit: Aight y‚Äôall I gotchu, I even read the post and didn‚Äôt make the connection without help cuz I have the attention span of a weasel on crack', 'score': 37, 'created_utc': 1588820443.0}, {'author': 'pixelated_fish', 'body': 'All majors are equal but some are more equal then others', 'score': 35, 'created_utc': 1588821041.0}, {'author': 'None', 'body': 'Celtic Studies culture is overwhelming!!!', 'score': 10, 'created_utc': 1588834647.0}, {'author': 'luanicorn', 'body': 'I live for this content.', 'score': 10, 'created_utc': 1588827693.0}, {'author': 'SirensToGo', 'body': 'god this reads like a post from /r/ProrgammerCritical. fuck off.\n\n/unjerk: I love this sub', 'score': 17, 'created_utc': 1588821766.0}, {'author': 'SouthernYankeeWitch', 'body': 'I mean, this post is a lot more believable than the transphobic one.', 'score': 8, 'created_utc': 1588859993.0}, {'author': 'mOrange2', 'body': ""I feel this on a spiritual level (/s I read the og one lmao) with fucking eecs people EEEKs REEK.

DON‚ÄôT feel bad about using free time to rest. Online or not, Berkeley is challenging. Mental health is already threatened by the external circumstances, and I encourage you guys to take care as school starts. 

Rest does not mean being unproductive. It means being proactive about your well-being, and putting your well-being in a good state will make your daily activities less strenuous. 

Rest can look like:
- reading an easy book for fun
- spending an hour to follow a recipe or make a new dessert (I miss Berkeley Bowl so so much)
- organizing online game nights/trivia with friends (team challenges are great for bonding)

I used to go to he‚Äôs discussion section during early in the semester and then switched to another section. 

But ever since then, he has been sending me multiple friend requests and messages on Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and snapshot. He keeps trying to ask me how I am, what have I been up to, and what courses I am taking. He would even go off on several messages about the internships he received this summer. During ever encounter, I try to be as nice and polite as I can to let him know I am busy and not interested in socializing. I tried to avoid him as best as I can by not replying but he has never stopped messaging. I would get notifications 2:00am in the morning when I would try to be sleeping. He even sent me private post once on the piazza course.

Last week, I started blocking him but then I saw him make multiple additional new accounts just to message me again.

Worst of all, I began noticing that he would show up in all my breakout rooms for homework parties. He wouldn‚Äôt be helping other students, he would just be staying quiet most of the time and making few remarks with the other GSI. You may think this may just sound like a coincidence but whenever I switch rooms he would follow me to the very same room. This has been happening 4x in the last week.

I tried my best to not provoke or get him to be angry but at this point I honestly feel totally creeped out and scared.

I am trying to find resources on campus to make a report about this because I don‚Äôt know whether to send a direct message/email to the professors (because they barley respond) or the course staff because I do not know who knows him/friends with. I don‚Äôt want other students involved, only professional representatives to address in the situation. 

I don‚Äôt want mention the course specifically here because I don‚Äôt want to attract attention. I just want to be able to maturely move on from this issue as best as I can. I am already stressed by the workload for this semester and I don‚Äôt want more anxiety in my life. I spent all week last week crying because of how horrible things have been lately with trying to find a job, family, and school. My mom recently got laid off and my dad has been juggling multiple things. I don‚Äôt want to tell them about this because I don‚Äôt want them to be even more stressed with their lives. 

I‚Äôve only told one of my best friends about this because I needed someone to talk to. She said I should just go straight to the police at this point. 

I would appreciate if anyone could help me find the right department to address this to. I have sent only 2 emails (student affairs and eecs department) but haven‚Äôt heard any responses.","[{'author': 'Historical-Web-9235', 'body': 'Send an email straight to the professor and title it Harassment from GSI.

243,ij0o4j,None,342.0,0.99,26,berkeley,"Hey Bears,

So my dad died last week. His body wasn't found till Tuesday morning, and it would have been longer if I hadn't gotten seriously worried that he hadn't responded to my text about making all A's my first summer here. I feel like I've been hit by a truck emotionally. I have no idea how to process any of this. He lived halfway across the country in Arkansas and I'm having to make all the arrangements to get him cremated via email. I want to be around other people that knew him, but I'm in a high-risk category for COVID-19 and I couldn't afford to make the trip back. He was basically a hermit and didn't talk to many people anyway. I think the people who saw him the most were the cashiers at the closest liquor store. My mom is going in my stead to figure out what to do with his decrepit old house and that helps considerably in a practical sense but it means that she's not here to mourn with me. My father and I had a complicated, awkward, and at times downright painful relationship but over the past year it really seemed like it was improving, and I was really hopeful that he would be able to visit me out here when I graduate. 

My professors are all being very kind and accommodating so far, but I'm really afraid of how this semester is going to go. I'm a new transfer so I was already kind of intimidated. I can't really afford to take a leave of absence because I'm dependent on financial aid (to make things worse my partner got laid off right before my dad died) but the idea of completing assignments right now feels next to impossible. Part of me feels like I need time off but then I wouldn't have much to distract me from my grief. I've talked to the CAPS crisis line and made an intake appointment for regular therapy (that I needed anyway) but that didn't feel like it helped much. My partner and other housemates are doing their best to comfort me but I think my coping mechanism of making really dark morbid jokes (which I think my dad would appreciate) is making them sort of uncomfortable, and none of them had ever met him so it's even harder for them to grasp what I'm feeling. I've never grieved a loss like this before and I don't know how to start. I don't even think I'll start to feel any sort of closure till my mom brings me his ashes back. I feel so utterly useless and I just wish there was something I could do for him besides filling out a bunch of fucking paperwork.

As you know, I've been following COVID very closely and trying to keep students informed of the situation.  And although I'm not an epidemiologist, my research includes the computer equivalents.  We are about to enter a very, very dark December and you should all prepare now.

As a reminder, COVID is an airborne pathogen but requires a significant challenge dose to be infected.  Airborne/aerosol means it is carried around in particles with roughly the size and behavior of smoke.  Worse, asymptomatic but infected individuals spread the virus very effectively.  Talking and singing spread more particles than just breathing.  This is why mask wearing is so critical: even the most basic cloth mask acts as a fairly effective filter for these particles when you breath out.

So imagine an infected person is smoking a joint.  For a pathogen like measles, if you smell the joint and were unvaccinated you'd be infected.  With COVID, you need a contact high.  This is why outdoors is so much safer than indoors, fleeting contact is far less significant than sustained contact, and why restaurants, bars, and family gatherings are such effective spreaders.  A bar, especially in winter, is a literal COVID hot-box.

It is also important to understand the risk.  For most University students the risk you face if you are infected with COVID is in roughly the same ballpark as joining a fraternity.  But it is a very different story for your parents: Even in the 40-50 year old range a COVID infection has a roughly 0.5% fatality rate when the hospital systems are well functioning, and this can drastically increase with both age and if the hospital system is overloaded.  Unless you are a sociopath, you would probably feel badly if, say, your wedding lead directly to 7 deaths.

At the same time, we are all suffering from COVID fatigue and claustrophobia.  We want this to end.  The good news is it will, soonish.  The timeline for widespread vaccinations in the spring is looking good, not just the Pfizer vaccine but others in the pipeline, and one of the few things the Administration has gotten right is building the distribution infrastructure now and agreeing to buy now large amounts of vaccine when it becomes available.

But with that background, the US is about to enter a crisis even worse than the first wave.

Cases have doubled in a little more than 10 days, the hospitals are already as full as they were in the first wave, and the US is proceeding like nothing is wrong.  United just added over 1400 flights for Thanksgiving.  At the same time the healthcare system is already breaking down: El Paso now has 10 refrigerated trucks serving as a temporary morgue while the state of Texas is suing to overturn local restrictions designed to reduce the spread!  Worse, hospitalizations lag cases by about a week and deaths by two weeks.  And yet a good 30% of the country thinks that masks are some plot to corrupt our precious bodily fluids.

This third wave is twice as many cases as the second (the first wave doesn't count for this comparison because the testing regime was too weak then).  That second wave had an average daily death toll of over 1000/day.  So as a nation we will be lucky if there is only one more doubling of the rate of new infections and a month of 2000-3000 dead each day: substantially more than the first wave.  But with the Thanksgiving holiday coming up, we are looking at a very dark December as so many are actively ignoring the pandemic.

So what to do?

It is time to effectively ""go to ground"", prepare to shelter in place for the next couple of months like the initial lockdown.  If you are with your parents, stay there.  But if you aren't, do not return home unless they get sick: this includes both Thanksgiving and the Christmas holiday.  Don't dine indoors, don't work out indoors, don't meet anyone outside your household indoors.  And spread the word to your family and those you love.

Thanksgiving-time shopping is going to be particularly perilous.  Grocery shop for the next two weeks now to avoid the pre-Thanksgiving mobs at the stores.  When you do go out, try to wear one of the disposable blue procedure masks rather than just a cloth mask: procedure masks do offer some level of incoming protection.  The N95s you got for the fires are not appropriate as they have breather valves, if you wear one of those, wear a cloth or blue-disposable over it.

If your parents or relatives want you home for the holidays, reply that you love them too much to risk it.  If they press further, say something like ""I give you a bowl of 200 M&Ms.  One will kill you.  One will cripple you.  Everyone over 40 gets to eat one if we have a family gathering.  Grandma needs to eat 5.  That is what happens if someone brings Covid to the family gathering.""

It is going to be a dark end to a dark year.  But there is light ahead.  The multiple vaccine candidates are looking very very good, the distribution system is in place, and Pfizer alone is gearing up for a billion+ doses in the next several months and Pfizer is not the only one.  So to end on a happy note, with high confidence my office hours in Fall 2021 will allow me to wait for people to show up in person rather than over zoom.","[{'author': 'avidfanatic12', 'body': ""Unfortunately my parents and their friends don't care and are still having indoor parties of 30+ for Indian festivals."", 'score': 212, 'created_utc': 1605290094.0}, {'author': 'nemicolopterus', 'body': ""I'm always confused by these posts because we never stopped locking down.

252,g9vxb0,NicholasWeaver,809.0,0.98,102,berkeley,"I posted this to the class Piazza, but I realize there might be a wider audience for this.

tl:dr:  I‚Äôm highly doubtful we will have in-person classes in the fall, even in a ‚Äúhybrid model‚Äù where large lectures are online but discussion & labs continue in person.  So I‚Äôm planning at least for on-line only for Fall 2020.

Disclaimer:  I am not an epidemiologist but a fair bit of this is remarkably close to my wheelhouse.  Internet pandemics were my first major post-grad research area and detector sensitivity is a key problem in network security.

 

This disease is nasty: I‚Äôm basing this on South Korea‚Äôs data.  South Korea managed to test & trace their way out of the epidemic, which means they caught most of the carriers, so the ‚Äútotal cases‚Äù as well as the ‚Äútotal deaths‚Äù number is probably about right  (testing is by PCR, so it only detects active infections).  https://www.statista.com/statistics/1105088/south-korea-coronavirus-mortality-rate-by-age/

Even with a fully functioning health-care system, those infected who are between 30 and 39 have a .17% chance of death. To put that in perspective, roll two dice.  If they come up snake-eyes, roll again.  If the total is 3 or less, you die lonely and alone, drowning on dry land.  And the odds get progressively worse.  40-49 is .21%.  50-59 is .77%, making a second role of 5 or less mean death.  60-69 it becomes 2.6%, so don‚Äôt bother with the second roll: snake-eyes means death.  Over 70 is a 10% fatality rate.

And there seems to be a lot of willful denial on just how deadly it is, notably from down at Stanford lead by John Ioannidis.

In particular the Stanford serology studies which try to detect infection by antibody presence (both in the Bay Area and LA) are criminally bad.

The Bay Area they released a preprint https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.14.20062463v1 (but the LA as far as I know is still just a press release! http://createsend.com/t/j-296D9D8CE54262BB2540EF23F30FEDED )  I don‚Äôt know why people want to think this is less serious than it is, but they do.

Let us count the ways.  The first is that their test has a ‚Äúspecificity‚Äù (correctly reporting a negative as a negative) of 99.5% with a confidence interval of 98.3-99.9%.  The inverse of that is the false positive rate (how we think of it from a computer security standpoint): so with 95% confidence it is between 0.1% and 1.7%.  Their raw data showed a 1.5% positive rate.

So they can‚Äôt say with confidence that they found any true positives in their raw data!

It gets worse.  How they recruited people in the Stanford study is a great way to ensure a lot of sample bias, including the wife of the lead researcher emailing others in a highly ethically questionable way and also a series of Facebook ads.  If just 1.5% of their volunteers saw the Facebook ad they used for recruitment, went ‚Äúhmm, I was coughing badly last month, and wasn‚Äôt able to get tested, I want to find out for myself‚Äù, then even a test with NO false positives would account for all their data that way.

And then they compound it with math errors.  They adjust based on demographics to get their headline 2.81% figure (uh, how did this turn into 3 significant figures?).  And it is only then that they apply the false positive rate to the confidence interval!

That they haven‚Äôt slapped a ‚Äúwithdrawn‚Äù on the preprint, after being alerted to these numerous problems by many many people, to my mind is professional malpractice.

New York City‚Äôs serology data may be better: ~20% infected, 1% overall fatality rate, would be 8.4 million * .01 * .2 = 17,000 dead.  New York City‚Äôs reported Covid deaths are >16k, with another 4000 non-Covid reported excess deaths https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/21/world/coronavirus-missing-deaths.html  .  So assuming the NYC serology is accurate, this suggests a >1% fatality rate across the entire population when the health care system gets overwhelmed, so even more fatal than the South Korea numbers.

It is also remarkably hard to detect for a simple detection & response strategy:  Fever screenings, which worked against SARS, don‚Äôt work here as presymptomatic individuals are highly contagious: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5 .   This is probably the biggest difference between Covid-19 and SARS, SARS generally didn‚Äôt have presymptomatic carriers.  We have to use much more invasive and expensive testing for any detection & response strategy to work.

And finally indoor spaces are particularly dangerous.  The ‚ÄúCall Center X‚Äù case https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/8/20-1274_article can be assumed to have caught almost all those infected.  In general, you don‚Äôt have asymptomatic infection: out of 97 cases, only 4 were asymptomatic, but many were detected presymptomatic.  But the airborn spread in enclosed spaces is a nightmare.  This was a 20 story, mixed use residential/commercial building, with an open-plan call center on three floors and no company restaurant.  All but 3 infections were on the same floor: over 40% of those on that one floor were infected.  And the figure 2 is even worse: https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/8/20-1274-f2 , showing just how dangerous this can be indoors.

On the other hand this means we are over-obsessing about hand washing and surfaces: everyone uses the lobby, elevators, doors, and the spread was restricted to the single floor.

The other telling case is ‚ÄúRestaurant X‚Äù from Guanghzhou China, https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/7/20-0764_article again with a horrifically telling figure: https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/7/20-0764-f1 .  Over the space of an hour and a half, along the flow of the air conditioning, at least 2 people at different tables were infected, probably by a single person who wasn‚Äôt demonstrating symptoms.

All this means is I‚Äôm not sure if even a hybrid model would work for reopening in the fall: even if our students are ‚Äújust‚Äù in the 0.1% fatality range it is unacceptably bad to bury too many students, and our student population interact within the larger community.  ‚ÄúRestaurant X‚Äù could easily be a Dorm Dining Commons or a discussion section.  ‚ÄúCall Center X‚Äù certainly looks like the layout of our computer labs. 

Perhaps with aggressive test and trace and 100% mask wearing for source control we might be able to hold in-person classes, but given how dismal the US has been so far about containing this thing, with willful denial becoming a partisan issue, I really worry that we won‚Äôt have the infrastructure in place by the fall even in California.  As such I‚Äôm planning on on-line only for the fall and I think we all probably should.

As you are undoubtedly aware, there is now a very high probability that the University's lecturers will be on strike on Wednesday the 17th and Thursday the 18th.  As one such lecturer I'm faced with a difficult decision.  I'm personally treated well, and the reason I do this job is to serve my students.  So I feel like I'm betraying you if I strike.

But I've decided: I will be on strike if one occurs. 

So if there is a strike lecture will be formally cancelled on Wednesday the 17th.  I will still be in the zoom room however, and available for any questions people have about the strike, the larger context, and other issues.  And on Thursday I'll probably be walking the picket line itself at Bancroft & Telegraph.

But some background as to why I feel the need to join the strike:

The EECS department individually treats lecturers like me well: we are effectively considered part of the faculty (unlike some other departments) and our pay is reasonable (aka high by lecturer standards, although low by say ""police investigator"" standards). If you are curious, everybody's salary is public and available at https://transparentcalifornia.com/ .

But how the department can treat us is often constrained by the larger university, and the larger university seriously neglects the lecturers.

At Berkeley, 40% of the student credit/hours (that is, actual teaching, you know, the thing that we are supposed to be doing.) is done by lecturers.  Yet we represent <20% of the academic payroll costs (excluding the cost of administrators and coaches!  So just the cost of professors etc).  And this is skewed in two ways: 

There are a few Haas lecturers that are paid very well and the EECS department, which is currently teaching a huge fraction of our undergraduate population, has less reliance on lecturers than some other departments as we actually have a few teaching professors and most of our faculty will do one large class a year.  So I suspect that ""40% of the teaching, <20% of the pay"" is really closer to 50% of the teaching and <15% of the pay when you exclude these two outliers, but I haven't run the numbers to confirm that.

So for the larger health of the University it is clear they have to treat those who are actually performing the University's stated mission better.

And even I, arguably amongst the best situated lecturers in the University, find that the University's mistreatment is frustrating to say the least.  What the University considers a ""full time"" teaching load for a lecturer is just ridiculously high.  As an example, the University initially insisted that co-teaching both CS161 (~450 students) and CS61C (~1000 students) together is only a 60% time job.  Fortunately the department's bureaucratic ninjas were able to fix that incident, but it is symptomatic of a larger problem.  Apparently the University think the time it takes to teach a 20 student class and a 1000 student class is effectively the same, that all our effort is O(1) as a function of class size.  I wish.

So yes, I'll be supporting the lecturer strike.  If a strike happens (now looking highly likely) lecture on Wednesday will be cancelled but I'll be in the zoom room for anyone who wants to talk about this situation and other related issues.","[{'author': 'rojotoro2020', 'body': 'First time hearing about this.

The EECS department is shattering under load due to having gone from 400 graduates a year a decade ago to 1400 graduates/year now. 15% of the University is graduating in either EECS or L&S CS, a load that is breaking the department through a combination of both budgetary pressure and the grind of so many students.

The TL:DR is that the University formula for how teaching funds are distributed (the ‚ÄúTAS budget‚Äù) is broken.  The department gets roughly $200 for a student in a typical 4-unit class, but costs roughly $375 to hire all the TAs necessary, with the remaining $175 coming out of other departmental money.  This departmental funding comes from ‚Äúprofitable‚Äù programs (M.Eng, extension, and summer) and a portion from the University that is basically a function of the size of the faculty in the department, which clearly hasn‚Äôt scaled with demand.

So the EECS department is running a deficit of a few million dollars a year and the only ways to fix it are for either the University to actually fund undergraduate teaching or for EECS to drastically cut enrollment by over 50%!  And it isn‚Äôt a lot of money.  Perhaps $4-5M a year.

But the budget is almost an excuse.  The teaching load is ridiculous and things are failing.  If we lose one or two critical must-teach-every-semester upper division classes (e.g. 161, 186, 188, 189) we lose the undergraduate talent pipeline necessary to support 1000+ students a year in that class.  Even someone like me, who likes teaching, has grown exhausted from teaching just the same two classes on a continuous basis.

The department has to take drastic action.  Last year there was a rejected attempt to reduce L&S by turning it into an EECS-style freshman admission.  Since that failed there is a pending vote to cut the size of the major through the back-door.  By restricting CS70 to just those who were admitted as EECS or CS through L&S, this would cut in half the number of students who declare CS or EECS.

There is an asterisk in the proposal for existing L&S and non-EECS Engineering students but that is ‚Äúbudget permitting‚Äù and, as clearly visible, the budget doesn‚Äôt actually permit this.  And if the department was serious about allowing existing students they wouldn‚Äôt have capped CS70 this summer at just 200 students, since summer classes (due to their profitable nature) normally scale to support however many students wish to take a class.

What does this mean?  First, nothing is official yet.  The vote result is unannounced, and even then there could be a miracle and Berkeley actually decides to fund EECS to a level necessary to meet demand.  But color me unhopeful.

So assuming it passes, what does it mean?

If you are considering Berkeley for CS starting Fall 2022 but didn‚Äôt select ‚ÄúCS‚Äù or ‚ÄúEECS‚Äù on the application form you will need to go someplace else.  I doubt any policy will protect you, and the department‚Äôs failure to communicate this already infuriates me.

If you were admitted as EECS or selected ‚ÄúCS‚Äù for a Letters and Science admission you should be OK.  Well, in the same sinking boat as everyone else if the department fails in maintaining the upper division.

If you are L&S but didn‚Äôt check ‚ÄúCS‚Äù, or a non-EECS Engineering student, it may be impossible to get into CS if you can‚Äôt get into CS70 this summer.  The only thing that can save you is if somehow the University is willing to provide enough money to actually teach the demand.

If the department had the funding it could possibly develop the will to continue to teach at our scale.  But since I doubt the money would ever come, there is no sense trying to cultivate the will.","[{'author': 'Several-Detective-33', 'body': 'I planned on double majoring in applied math and CS, will this somehow also affect the ability to use Math 55 in place of CS 70 for the declaration of both majors?', 'score': 74, 'created_utc': 1647906641.0}, {'author': 'Royal_Estimate_4871', 'body': 'Can we protest for more EECS funding?

256,ijg71s,NicholasWeaver,486.0,0.98,38,berkeley,"This semester is going to suck.  But there are a couple things to do that could make it suck just a little bit less.  It starts with understanding the nature of the disease.  Knowing that, you now know how you can safely meet up with friends without needing to worry.  Just do it masked up and outdoors.

Covid-19 is spread primarily through the air, both in droplets (larger hunks expelled when you cough or sneeze) and aerosols (fine particles that are emitted when breathing, talking, and singing and can float in the air like smoke).  There is a particular blindness in public health circles that discounted the latter but, at this point, aerosols need to be considered as critical as droplets for spreading the disease.

Imagine you are with a friend who‚Äôs smoking and talking.  As they talk, clouds of smoke drift out of their mouth.  If you breath too much of it, you get sick.  This is why the 6‚Äô ‚Äúrule‚Äù is silly.  6‚Äô applies to droplets but it doesn‚Äôt apply to aerosols.  Instead, the BMJ has a better way to think about it in the form of a busy graphic which comes down to a few factors: Crowding, air circulation, masks, and time.

Basically, the bigger the crowd, the less air circulation, the fewer people with masks, and longer exposure all increase the risk.  But this also means that wearing masks and staying outdoors really reduce the risk.  The rate of outdoor transmission is so much lower than indoor transmission.

Did you hear about the Trump 4th-of-July rally at Mt Rushmore turning into a superspreader event?  Or massive outbreaks due to BLM protests?  No?  Because that never happened.  Lots of people crowded together and yet there weren‚Äôt major outbreaks.  Trump‚Äôs Tulsa rally was in an arena and Herman Cain died as a result but the Mt Rushmore event and BLM protests are all outdoors.

I am actually in the age group where I do need to worry about COVID personally rather than just from a public health standpoint, I‚Äôve been watching this thing semi-professionally since February, and I‚Äôd be willing to hold in-person office hours out on the terrace outside the Wozniak lounge if the students and myself were wearing masks.

As soon as the University allows it I will be spending my Wednesdays under a beach umbrella there, in a lounge chair, with an extension cord for my laptop, and be willing to meet with any student who drops by.

So you want to meet with some friends to ‚Äústudy‚Äù?  Sure, just wear masks and meet in Memorial glade.

So you want to enjoy a cool refreshing beverage?  Well, you can‚Äôt wear a mask but sit a bit farther apart in a nice breeze.

Want to go on a hike with a few friends once the smoke goes away?  Do it!  Just drive in separate cars (unless somebody has a convertible in which case throw the top down, wear masks, blast some tunes and enjoy the drive).

So get together with friends outside.  We are fortunate here in California, even in the winter many days are cool, crisp, and dry.

258,rrlhhs,NicholasWeaver,353.0,0.94,48,berkeley,"Once again it is time for my personal observations & thoughts on the state of COVID and the University.

So far the data on Omicron appears near best-case in terms of impact given its hyper-virulent nature.  Its unclear how severe it is for those not vaccinated but for those who are vaccinated and boosted Omicron does appear to be ""just a cold"", albeit one that would still be very serious for those in high risk communities such as immuno-compromised individuals.

As such although the surge in infections is breathtaking (even more than Delta was, and totally trashing Covid Classic in infectiousness), hospitalizations are only starting to tick up and even that may be due to remaining Delta infections.  We saw this in South Africa, the UK, and we seem to be following the trajectory here.  This is about the best case scenario we can have.

This of course leaves the University going into the spring semester in a really tough position.  If they decide to start with in-person instruction on the 18th they will get a lot of flak for ""ignoring COVID"".  If they go remote-only at the start, they will get a lot of flack for ""overreacting"".   But I bet the University will announce shortly the first two weeks are remote, and in the end I think its the right decision but not for the one you might think.

The reason why this is the right decision is accessibility.  A huge fraction of the student body returning from break is going to get Covid.  A huge fraction of the faculty and staff will.  I'm cautious bordering on paranoid and I think I'll probably get it.  But I'm not actually worried about it.  But getting it is disruptive.

A vaccinated individual who's infected but either asymptomatic or mild symptoms is supposed to isolate for 5 days after a positive test under the new CDC guidance, and IMO that guidance is broken.  [1].  But given such guidance or even more conservative university guidance, a COVID+ is a loss of a week+ of schooling or work if things are in person.  But if remote it is no loss at all, its the same sucky shit for all of us.
¬†
So my bet is the following:

Omicron from a public health standpoint ends up a fairly minor event compared to Delta and Covid Classic.  This is even moreso for the University population that has a vaccine mandate.

Omicron from a disruption standpoint however is more significant, because a huge fraction are going to end up infected.  Combined with a university administration that is generally cautious about anything not involving the football team's TV revenues and stadium sponsorships, I think it is highly likely the first couple weeks will be online only.


[1] It should be you should isolate until two days of negative on ANTIGEN testing, not PCR, since PCR is too sensitive but the antigen (take-home) tests are basically matching infectiousness with their sensitivity level.  Of course, this would have also required the US to actually approve the diverse # of vendors that make such tests instead of basically creating a de-facto duopoly up until very very recently.","[{'author': 'pocketswoledanny', 'body': 'Babe wake up Nick posted his latest COVID thoughts', 'score': 213, 'created_utc': 1640833702.0}, {'author': 'Revolutionary_List31', 'body': 'My sister goes to uni in the UK and that is the rule there.

259,p22jcj,NicholasWeaver,347.0,0.97,75,berkeley,"As the semester is rapidly approaching, and as I believe it is important to keep students abreast of what I believe is happening, here are my thoughts on reopening.  Keep in mind I have no non-public information and I‚Äôm not speaking for the University in any way.

A month ago I was really excited.  The case rate in Alameda was < 2 per 100k, the University made clear that vaccinations are mandatory, and all looked like we‚Äôd be on track for a mostly normal fall.  Which is something I was really looking forward to.

Now we are in the midst of the Delta wildfire.  Cases are doubling about every 7-10 days, Alameda is >20 per 100k, and 3 more weeks of growth at this rate and Alameda would be at the height of the winter peak.  It seems that unless you have >80% vaccinated Delta is going to successfully spread.  So significantly more virulent than Covid Classic‚Ñ¢, but not nearly as bad as measles.

At the same time, if you are vaccinated Delta is far less scary.  Although it appears that Delta is more infectious, the vaccines are still effectively 100% where it counts: keeping you out of the hospital and out of the morgue.  You still don‚Äôt want it, a ‚Äúnon severe‚Äù case of Covid might leave you miserable for a week or more and feeling like you‚Äôve been run over by a freight train, but the life and death potential, already low for the Berkeley student cohort, is basically nil.  Even for older folks like me the risk of death is now vastly lower.


So what I hope to happen:  In person but with precautions.

100% mask required, except perhaps for the lecturer on stage.  A while ago I upgraded from ‚Äúcloth‚Äù to ‚Äúprocedure‚Äù as my standard mask, and now I‚Äôm just gone full N95/KN95/KF94 mask.  For both my classes the lecture is going to be with an in-person room for some students with both a zoom simulcast (for those remote who want to ask live questions) and recordings available afterwards.  Exams will be hybrid: those unable or uncomfortable with in-person exams will have a remote version.

In my office I‚Äôm going to keep my window open and/or a HEPA filter running.  And my office hours are going to be outside.  Likewise I need to ensure that TA office hours are similarly protected, and try to make sure the department buys HEPA filters for labs and similar spaces.  Especially for 61C, the in-person components of office hours, labs, and project parties are so critical that I feel we must offer them if possible.

I do expect that some faculty will be less comfortable than I am and may peremptorily switch their classes to an online-only mode.  Especially older faculty may very well take advantage of this, so don‚Äôt be surprised if one or two of your in-person classes become something remote.


But what I fear will happen: Delta rips through the University and Berkeley pulls the plug.  Which of course would happen with no notice.

If we do indeed have a fully vaccinated population I don‚Äôt think Delta will take off and, even if it does, I don‚Äôt think it can do substantial damage.  But the University has shown itself to be conservative on such issues.  Worse, I have a bad feeling that far too many are going to opt-out of the vaccine claiming a religious exemption (such as fealty to Great Cthulhu) which will enable Delta to catch fire.

In any case, if you haven‚Äôt yet, **GET VACCINATED!**  The more people that get vaccinated the less likely the bad things happen and we are forced back into our Zoom Caves.","[{'author': 'AndersonxCooper', 'body': 'if someone in a class tests positive for Covid will they quarantine the class for two weeks and make it online? if like four people in a 70 person class got Covid would they be okay with the other 66 people going about their days?', 'score': 80, 'created_utc': 1628644594.0}, {'author': 'Top-Jeweler-6619', 'body': 'Remember that the school can also go online due to other reasons like air quality.

3. Look over all posted assignments. This will let you know what material you‚Äôre expected to know by now. What‚Äôs on the assignment will be on the test. Fuck everything else.

269,brj3jf,Mark_Slinky,405.0,0.96,90,berkeley,"My friend, who is going to Stanford, and I have been debating this question for a while. If Stanford and UC Berkeley got into a war, which campus would successfully be able to capture the other college's campus. 

Things we have considered:

1) Endowment: Stanford has around 5 times the endowment than Berkeley (Around 25 billion vs 5 billion). In a war, Stanford would have a better funded military than Berkeley. This can prove to be huge, especially with war technology.

2) School Size: Berkeley will have a significantly larger army. Berkeley has 42,000 students compared to 17,000 students at Stanford. In terms of capturing a campus, Berkeley could overpower Stanford. While a larger army will be beneficial in battle, this also means Berkeley must maintain a larger amount of people. Feeding, housing, etc, can be become a problem, especially with Berkeley's lower endowment.

3) Location: Berkeley is closer to the coast, which means a naval advantage. Berkeley is also on a hill with a forest, which can result in some war advantages. However, Stanford has a much larger campus (8,200 acres vs 1200 acres). Taking over a larger campus will bring difficulties for Berkeley.

4) Weaponry: Both schools are very accomplished in engineering. However, each school has their own specialities. Stanford is ranked highly in aerospace engineering, while Berkeley is ranked highly in nuclear engineering. Berkeley is also very accomplished in chemistry, which can be beneficial in developing new weapons. Stanford, however, probably has a marginal advantage in research.

5) Hospital: Stanford has a highly ranked hospital that is world-renowned. This could prove to be useful in dealing with war casualties. 

6) Faculty: Berkeley has more faculty, which could result in better leadership in war.

7) Internal issues: Berkeley can suffer from anti-war rhetoric and protests in war-time.

8) War sprit/pride: Which students are more proud and willing to protect their college? This is subjective, but me and my friend think Stanford students are more patriotic for their college.

9) Military conditions: Berkeley has had some incidents with housing conditions. Housing an army could be a struggle for Berkeley. Stanford might have higher morale in their army.

We are also under the assumption that all other institutions and governments are independent from this conflict. Therefore, the UC system or the California state government cannot aid Berkeley.

I'm taking F's on homework assignments, asking for extensions, and generally coming off as a fool in discussion sections where I've missed key parts of previous lectures.

Obviously this is college, and it'd be a bit of a firehose even under normal circumstances-- I get that. 

But missing 20% of my scheduled class/instruction time is clearly making things harder. It's driven home to me just how easy it is for someone to fall behind because of circumstances beyond their control, and even more importantly, how hard it can be to catch up. I'm facing mental and emotional barriers like I've never seen before. I can't imagine going through this during my early developmental years, I think it would have destroyed me.

Looking back on K-12, I realize that most of the burnouts and dropouts weren't any lazier or dumber than average. The gap between me and them was almost entirely circumstantial, but it grew enormously as time went on, and that feels like an indictment of something.

I'm still praying that CoE goes P/NP, but it's hitting me that there is no P/NP equivalent for elementary, middle, and high schoolers who were going through this (and much worse) pre-COVID.","[{'author': 'TakeDaDub', 'body': ""I love this post.

First, go to every lecture and make a cheat sheet. During the lecture, don't waste your time fiddling with your phone. Stay focused.

Next, go to discussion and really refine that cheat sheet. For everybody else, it will look like you're just taking notes.

Now here comes the sneaky part, approximately two weeks before the exam, gather all the cheat sheets you made and hide it in your brain. If your brain is too small for all the cheat sheets, try to split the notes into pieces and try to put them in bit by bit. It is also important that if your brain is full, go to bed and let it digest for 7-8 hours and you're good to go again.

Hi guys! Before club rush starts again in the fall, I wanted to write down some thoughts for anyone thinking of joining a consulting club/CS organization/business frat. I think there are some serious changes that need to be made to the whole club culture at Berkeley.

I was briefly a member of one of these types of clubs and most of my observations stem from this perspective, having seen these kinds of clubs from both the outside and the inside.

Any club with a selection process that has multiple interviews is IMO really toxic and frankly, stupid. If you‚Äôve ever applied to a real-life company, you‚Äôll know that these clubs have straight up copied this process, sometimes word for word. This whole concept is laughably ridiculous, especially once you remember that your ‚Äúinterviewer‚Äù is probably the same age as you. They only serve to create an artificial barrier of exclusivity that makes people feel bad about themselves for no reason.

This becomes more toxic because it can make people evaluate their self-worth based on these bogus rejections/acceptances. It‚Äôs important that you understand that if you get into a club, it doesn‚Äôt make you any better than anyone else. If you don‚Äôt get in, it doesn‚Äôt make you any less. The people judging you are your peers, and in my experience the selection process is extremely subjective and often nepotist.

When you get in, prepare to be pressured into sinking your time into the club. For whatever reason, a bunch of these clubs will make you undergo a ‚Äúrush‚Äù semester, even if they‚Äôre not actually frats. Basically, they‚Äôll try to get you to spend an entire semester doing stupid bullshit to prove that you belong. There are so many better ways to spend your time than this.

You‚Äôre probably thinking that you want to join a club to find friends/career advancement, but trust me when I say that you don‚Äôt need these kinds of clubs to help you do this. These clubs will actively try to sell you an image of happiness and success in order to get you to join. You realize that something is terribly wrong when a senior is spending their afternoon begging naive freshmen to join their club, and your club requires you to wake up at 3 am in the morning to stake out a spot for your table on Sproul the next day.

People at these clubs are not more successful that other people. These clubs perpetrate the idea that if you don‚Äôt get into their club, you won‚Äôt be successful at Berkeley. This is completely untrue. Yes, these clubs will try to flex their members that work at top companies, but those members are a small subset of the tons of more people at Berkeley who do, including many of my friends and I (none of them who joined these clubs). From the time I was in the club, I had no support at all with my career goals, and I would even say that it has been actively detrimental towards its members‚Äô career goals because they force you to work on their own possibly crappy projects/undergo a rush semester/have member duties towards the club. The success you achieve will be up to you, not what club you are a part of.

I know I‚Äôm only talking about the bad parts of these clubs here but I think these are all important things to keep in mind.

Finally:

For those of you who are feeling alone, feeling like you need a community, feeling like you need to join a cool club and show off to your friends, I get it. I really do. It's normal to feel like this, everyone does especially when they start college, and I was in your shoes just recently and can tell you this: you‚Äôll find so many wonderful friends at Berkeley just by doing what you love. These kinds of clubs didn't help me find friends. Berkeley is such a lovely place and there are so many opportunities waiting for you out here. Think carefully about what you want, and I hope you‚Äôll find what you‚Äôre looking for.","[{'author': 'Alpacaman__', 'body': 'This an ultimate Haas snake 5d chess move to get into a consulting club.', 'score': 151, 'created_utc': 1595216652.0}, {'author': 'CrepesSuzzette', 'body': ""I can't speak  for consulting/business clubs, but CS clubs are for the most part a waste of time lol.

The people matters way more than the ""prestige"" of the club. In non-covid times I would say go to infosessions and talk to current members and see if you like the vibe of the club. Some clubs are very fratty or very uptight and pre-professional, both of which turn me off.\n\n2) Consulting club projects aren\'t very representative of real consulting work, because a lot of consulting involves data analysis and no company is gonna give students important data even if we all signed NDAs. That said, the practice of decking and presenting was very helpful and transferable.\n\n3) Go for a case interview workshop. If you don\'t like it, don\'t apply for consulting. The case interview workshop is an easy way for you know if you might be interested in consulting or just (fairly) think it\'s complete bs\n\n4) It\'s very possible to recruit consulting without being in a club. I found that my club helped me by giving me access to casebooks (helpful since I wasn\'t haas) and by letting me know more people who had similar career aspirations so that we could case each other and commiserate through the recruiting process.

Most clubs think that by deflating acceptance rates to like 3% by flyering a lot and getting hundreds of clueless freshmen to apply, they can artificially generate ""prestige"" for themselves and run with it.\n\nWhile this works to an extent (as seen in the number of posts in this sub talking about groups like Blueprint and MLAB vs. the number of people actually in these orgs), the effect of this rapidly diminishes once you leave the Berkeley bubble (ask any senior Google engineer or Stanford student what they think of Blueprint, and you\'ll probably get a lot of confused questions about what the blueprint is for), and especially once you compare how students in these orgs do to students outside these orgs a few years down the line (folks in these clubs go on to get great jobs and make a lot of connections, but so do folks not in these clubs too‚Äì being in the club, strictly speaking, is not as big of a confounding factor).\n\nI want to take an actually prestigious college club‚Äì the Harvard Crimson‚Äì as a contrasting example. Most people here have probably heard of Harvard\'s student newspaper‚Äì they have their own (really long) [wikipedia page](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/The_Harvard_Crimson). They have made a name for themselves beyond just the Harvard name‚Äì ask anybody to name a random Harvard student org, and the Crimson is probably one of the first things to pop into their mind. You\'d think that with a reputation as storied as it currently has, the club would be the most exclusive on campus. \n\nAaand you\'d be incorrect! Any [student at Harvard can join](https://comp.thecrimson.com/) (ofc, this means that you have to get into Harvard, which is another story). So, how was it then, that this club was able to climb to the top of the Harvard food chain, beating out clubs at Harvard (like frats before they were abolished there) that have exclusivity and low acceptance rates?\n\nTwo things‚Äì famous alumni who were willing to trace back part of their success to the Crimson, and a club mission that was dedicated to changing the world for the better throughout its long and storied history. For example, its Wikipedia article lists that in the Cold War:\n> Crimson writers were involved in national issues, especially when anti-communist investigative committees came to Harvard. Future Pulitzer Prize‚Äìwinning writer Anthony Lukas\' stories (most notably, an interview with HUAC witness Wendell H. Furry) were sometimes picked up by the Associated Press.\n\nTaking a scroll through the club\'s really impressive alumni list (also, conveniently, [its very own wikipedia article](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/List_of_The_Harvard_Crimson_people)), we see numerous famous journalists and two of the most revered 20th century presidents: FDR and JFK, all of whom were willing to give their old college stomping ground a nod, decades after they made it into the limelight.\n\nIt is these extra indicators of prestige (a really long Wikipedia article on the club, coupled with a really long Wikipedia article of famous alumni) that ""exclusive"" Berkeley clubs cannot replicate with an artificially deflated 3% acceptance rate. (Now admittedly, these things can\'t be easily acquired by a new club founded in the past ~10 years, but this is why clubs founded in the past ~10 years can\'t really call themselves prestigious.) It is these factors that make most Americans look at a person in awe when they say they were a part of the Harvard Crimson, that also consequently don\'t make most Americans look at a person in awe when they said they were a part of Berkeley <highly competitive CS club here>. And the key thing is‚Äì this prestige was created through gathering enough crazily dedicated people to go and make a difference in the world, not by hosting extra rounds of interviews, forcing club members to get up at 3am to flyer at Sproul, making club members sacrifice hours of their free time on resume-padding projects, or by boasting their club\'s extremely low acceptance rates!\n\nSo my moral of the story is‚Äì go out and change the world through your own means, and don\'t let some stupid club\'s arbitrary gatekeeping rules determine your self worth! :)', 'score': 28, 'created_utc': 1595232677.0}, {'author': 'Just4brwsing', 'body': 'Another alternative is applying for legit jobs that have a student population such as course staffs or cs work at various other campus jobs.', 'score': 24, 'created_utc': 1595216065.0}, {'author': 'DamnableNook', 'body': 'As a CS alum who has interviewed a bunch of people in my career, I can tell you that these CS clubs wouldn‚Äôt make much difference to me.

Quick background, I moved to the dorms simply because my house is extremely loud. My family members also have little to no respect for my studying hours. So no, I did not come to party, I did not come to make friends, I am here for my success and that alone.¬†

Leading up to move in, I saw many comments in freshman group chats talking about how they don‚Äôt care about CDC guidelines and just want to go out. One guy even dared to say ‚Äúthis is America‚Äù in response to a girl explaining the importance of self sequestering. There was also a post going around a freshman facebook group asking who was living in Berkeley and wanted to party. I was nervous about moving in, but I did not think the majority of people moving to the dorms would be self-absorbed idiots.

For GBO the people on your floor and the floors around you are in your group (if you live in the dorms.) Throughout meeting and virtually interacting with people in my building, I‚Äôve come to realize my worst fears came true. Here are a couple of things I‚Äôve heard from people in random zoom breakout rooms. ‚ÄúFuck self sequestering I just want to hang out with people,‚Äù ‚Äúuhg I want to go to a party right now,‚Äù ‚Äúyeah we are going to go hang out and get food anyone want to come?,‚Äù¬† and of course ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if you guys are the type to actually care about COVID but‚Ä¶*insert random thing about hanging out*.‚Äù Plenty of people in my building went out to eat at restaurants in groups of 7+ people and some have been hanging out with people living off-campus. My building isn't even halfway through the self sequestering period. I can‚Äôt even imagine what it is like in other dorms. I contacted my RA in concern if this is an important issue, their response was that sequestering rules cannot be enforced.

Honestly, I am scared, because I share a lot of facilities with these people. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm overreacting, I feel like a total minority in my opinion. I hypothesize, a weird mix of FMO, loneliness, and teenage hormones are affecting my fellow buildingmates around me to be such morons. Hopefully, I meet people in my ‚Äúbubble‚Äù¬† who have respect for the rules. If not, I sadly will have to cut myself off from my ‚Äúbubble,‚Äù too many of them have already displayed selfish risky behavior. I can‚Äôt branch out because obviously that would threaten and jeopardize the people I share a restroom with, so I guess all my socializing will be on zoom haha.

So to sum it up,¬†

Are RA‚ÄôS doing enough? I feel honestly bad for because they bear the burden and stress of dumb freshmen(in a pandemic!!!). The University needs to step up and enforce stricter punishment. This punishment must be broadcasted and told to the residents, pressuring them into following CDC guidelines. Some freshmen are very self-absorbed, so a personal attack on their own being (aka strict punishment) would work better in my opinion.

Will a large number of freshmen in the dorms get COVID? Most likely yes, even if we get tested twice a week students will go out into the city, hang out, and bring COVID back to their dorm building. Hopefully, after a couple of cases get spread around they will learn(seems unlikely though).

Will the 12 people social bubble work? Haha definitely not, if things are already breaking now... I don‚Äôt trust the 12 people around me to respect my safety. At least one-third of the group will branch out to around 2-5 different people outside the bubble. Thus, the probability of getting COVID will be greater.

To any freshman feeling the FMO and peer pressure to break CDC guidelines. I feel you, I usually look out my window thinking about how things could be different and how I am missing out in life. However, things will change eventually, I will make the most of my college experience as it is and I will succeed even in these hard times. I try to remember the people around me working in custodial services, dining, and even my (mostly) dumb floor mates. They don‚Äôt deserve COVID. They all worked hard and are working hard, I must do my part in respect for their well being.¬†

We all know college is tough and stressful. It's extremely challenging not to lower your self worth whenever things don't go great in class. Some advocate a requirement to take a financial literacy class that teaches things about taxes, investment, retirement, etc. The point of such a class would be to set students up for future success. Many of us come straight from a busy, competitive high school schedule - to go straight into busy, competitive college lives. And these environments, while conducive to academic resilience, can be dangerous to unprepared minds. How can this be remedied?

I believe we should also all be required (with opt out) to take a 1 unit low workload class that covers many of the mental health issues affecting students: how to deal with imposter syndrome, separating self worth from your class performance, time/goal management, healthy academic relationships with your peers, cheating ethics, and anything else I forgot to mention. Think about how many Facebook/reddit posts we see featuring a student with a fragile mental state. We're not equipped to help them in the way they need. It is my opinion that if everyone was taught some tools to fight these toxic mindsets and stressors on their own (or how to seek out help when needed), overall student morale will improve greatly.

What do you all think? Would this be helpful? Waste of precious class hours? How might we get the administration to consider implementing this?

~~-----------------------------------------------------------~~

Edit 1: common concerns I see brought up:

- Mandatory vs. optional: I see it as an issue of self control. Making the class optional would reduce the number of students that take it greatly, and many of the same people that struggle with academic stress and mental health often don't have the willpower to seek help or motivate themselves. I also think that such a class would likely be really easy to ""pass"", such that those that don't think they benefit wouldn't need to put in much effort or focus on the class if they don't want to. But it's definitely understandable that if you feel like you are on top of your mental health and work ethic that this class may feel like a waste. Maybe an opt-out-mandatory class could be possible, where everyone is enrolled in the class by default and you can choose to drop it off you want?

-

- make it actually useful/not a waste: perhaps hiring therapists and clinical psychologists as instructors, and leading the class in small ""group-counceling"" sessions would be a good way to foster positive mindsets without making it just another class for people to stress about. The focus is to help students, not just put up another barrier to graduation.","[{'author': 'wholespoon', 'body': ""I'm so tempted to say this should be a GBO thing.

1. Stop making people feel guilty or ashamed if they want to have human interactions after 2 going on 3 years of isolation in a pandemic. People are NOT selfish or unconcerned about public health because they want to experience college or take advantage of the education they are paying thousands of dollars for. 

2. Let's be honest, online learning is SHIT. While it makes everything easier, most of us aren't learning. Furthermore, we are being deprived of the resources and opportunities in-person learning provides that we will never get in the future. 

3. At this stage, we need to move forward. If you are triple vaccinated, healthy, and young you do not need to be worried outside of being in contact with elderly and other at-risk groups ( who should have their accommodations). I'M vaccinated and if you are vaccinated too have done your job. FUCK the people who don't want to get vaccinated at this point. While the cases of Omocrion are up, the rate of hospitalization and deaths is low because this variant is more contagious and less deadly. 

4. Look, I identify as a liberal, however this mindset within the liberal community is just toxic and nonsensical. If you seriously expect people to lock themselves inside, cut off all social interaction, and pretend covid is the black plague, or vilify people for not taking extreme precautions you are delusional.","[{'author': 'Smarty_PantzAA', 'body': 'is the title clickbait? i thought there was no university decision saying online as cal is committed to in-person', 'score': 127, 'created_utc': 1641554551.0}, {'author': 'math-frog', 'body': ""i agree with this and im triple vaccinated. but im currently stuck in another country because of covid. how am i supposed to do classes if i literally can not be in berkeley?? we need a hybrid option if you aren't able to make it to class otherwise we quite literally will be failing school."", 'score': 71, 'created_utc': 1641563484.0}, {'author': 'RAISIN_BRAN_DINOSAUR', 'body': 'I thought the same way about this stuff until I went to r/nursing and saw just how badly the hospital system is collapsing.

> u/Goldenbear2023:

> Not sure what the point of this is. I didn't even apply to Stanford. And not because I didn't think I'd get in --it was because I visited and it felt like a freaking resort full of fakeness and contrived brochure level BS. Yes, the academics are great but no culture compares to that of Berkeley's. Berkeley, despite being a public university with a much smaller endowment and fewer resources, still easily matches Stanford in all fields, and exceeds in many others.

> Not to mention we have more nobel prize winners, credit for the atom bomb and PC mouse, CRISPR-Cas9, countless other inventions, more relevance in history and social movements, and 16 periodic elements discovered, e.g. Berkelium and Californium. Last I checked there's no Stanfordium or even Harvardium. And what was Stanford doing during the civil rights and free speech movement? Probably kissing the status quo's ass. The only perceived 'advantage' Stanford has is that it is slightly more selective at the undergraduate level and incubates a few more startups. But this isn't more impressive when you realize that Berkeley is designed to accept more students. And these soft factors mean absolutely nothing in the grand scheme of things. When you consider everything else, the academics, Berkeley wins hands down.

> The argument that Stanford is somehow ""better"" than Berkeley because it is more selective and has a few more resources at the undergraduate level is a joke. I'd much rather compare schools on real factors like a) nobel prize winners b) fields medal winners c) patents and inventions d) historical and social contributions e) research output to funding ratio. I'll give you one though, Stanford has more turing award laureates. But guess what? Berkeley is only two spots behind at #3 overall. But go ahead and compare all the other things I mentioned. And then report back and tell me in which of those Stanford eclipses Berkeley. Oh yeah, zero.

> A $28 billion dollar endowment and all Stanford can manage are razor thin margins in anything it ""beats"" Berkeley in? LMFAO. The real question is why isn't Stanford light years ahead if it has all that money? Why is it being beaten dollar for dollar by a public school?

> If you want to poke fun of me for my prior posts, at least be aware that I haven't posted anything about that particular topic since the backlash. But whatever, I guess I'll be the lightning rod for what many at Cal agree with. What happened happened. Move on. I already did. I'll just leave it at that.

Last week when I walked into my economics class I saw something I dread every time I close my eyes. Someone had brought their new gaming laptop to class. The Forklift he used to bring it was still running idle at the back. I started sweating as I sat down and gazed over at the 700lb beast that was his laptop. He had already reinforced his desk with steel support beams and was in the process of finding an outlet for a power cable thicker than Amy Schumer's thigh. I start shaking. I keep telling myself I'm going to be alright and that there's nothing to worry about. He somehow finds a fucking outlet. Tears are running down my cheeks as I send my last texts to my family saying I love them. The teacher starts the lecture, and the student turns his laptop on. The colored lights on his RGB Backlit keyboard flare to life like a nuclear flash, and a deep humming fills my ears and shakes my very soul. The entire city power grid goes dark. The classroom begins to shake as the massive fans begin to spin. In mere seconds my world has gone from vibrant life, to a dark, earth shattering void where my body is getting torn apart by the 150mph gale force winds and the 500 decibel groan of the cooling fans.

About a 2 months ago, I got my admission offer and the email said ""Welcome to UC Berkeley"" with a major in EECS. I literally don't even know what Berkeley is. I never put this as an option on my application and am really frustrated that they even gave this to me. I talked to some seniors on Discord group chats and they said that I should request a transfer to DeVry, which is apparently the best university and has the best campus. One also said I should try bovine university since I look like a guy who needs to strengthen his calves (?). Anyways, I declined my admission and submitted an application to switch to DeVry.

The robber came up to me out of no where and demanded my backpack and phone, which I surrendered to him without resistance after spotting a gun in his hand. In that moment, everything happened so quickly; you have no time to think.

I must say: it can be easy to support lenient criminal justice policies without having experienced armed robbery in broad daylight, on a populated sidewalk, in our crime-ridden city. (Update: [A recent commenter noted how our district attorney is working to *reduce* sentencing for gun crimes...](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/11lnq56/comment/jbf61d9/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) The brokenness we see in our communities goes deeper than inadequate social systems or developmental flaws, and so can't simply be resolved by structural reforms. Within us, there needs to be an internal change of heart, an encounter with truth, a realization of belonging to one another; and that begins in the home and with our charitable interactions with those closest to us.)

But thankfully, I am alive and unharmed. I am reminded how precious life is and the reality of how short life on earth can be. All the day-to-day things that I had worried about: hanging out with friends, what's for dinner, getting homework done became of trivial importance in light of this potentially life-ending occasion. Please pray a Hail Mary for the repentance of the robber--I forgive him and wish for his good--and please pray for all those who've been robbed recently in Berkeley.

319,qnqiz4,BecauseImBatman_irl,361.0,0.99,74,berkeley,"It‚Äôs time we talked openly about the enrollment and budgeting crisis that EECS is facing, which Professor Ayazifar alluded to earlier this week on the EECS 101 Piazza. Put shortly, the entire EECS department is in a precarious state. Faculty and course staff are severely overworked and desperately attempting to maintain current enrollment levels without the necessary funding to do so.

Over the last 10 years, the combined enrollment of EECS + L&S CS has ballooned from 380 a decade ago to 1,300 this year, which is about 15% of the graduating undergraduate population!

The available budget has not scaled accordingly. We have no new available full-time faculty. The $-per-student ratio in the budget has stayed constant or dropped, while TA costs have increased by 5‚Äì20%, depending on how many hours a TA works.

The only reason that we haven‚Äôt entirely collapsed yet is because a number of upper-division courses have scaled massively, against budget constraints. This means that we have enough seats per year for these 1,300 students to meet their graduation requirements‚Äîbut this is a very precarious situation. If our overworked faculty fails an upper division course even one semester, we disrupt the traditional pipeline of course staff (student to reader to TA), and our upper division capacity drops below what is needed to be able to sustain the current graduation rate (i.e. students can‚Äôt graduate on time).

There are only two options:

Option #1: We scale. We need funding from the University to do this, which we have not received. We also need explicit buy-in from the EECS department to support the level of teaching necessary, i.e. the department formally embraces scalability rather than just having scalability thrust upon it.

Option #2: We cut enrollment. This was the new, proposed declare-upon-admission scheme for the L&S CS major, which would have reduced enrollment in a way that allowed students from both traditionally technical and non-traditionally technical backgrounds to have equal opportunity to the major. L&S vetoed this proposal. The only other way to reasonably cut enrollment is to substantially limit L&S CS as a program, severely capping enrollment to the courses needed to declare.

How this affects you:

Funding per student from the University is going down  while enrollment is going up, so the enrollment situation is only getting worse.

There is a very real chance that an upper-division course will collapse. You may not be able to take enough courses to graduate on time.

There is a very real chance that we will be forced to significantly limit L&S CS as a major. If you haven‚Äôt declared, you may never get to declare.

We truly would love to teach every student who expresses an interest in EE/CS, but we can‚Äôt do it without University support. The only options that are left to us, without an increase in funding, are desperate.

Currently, we would like to pursue a Town Hall with EECS administrative faculty to get the full picture of the enrollment and funding crisis. There is still so much we don‚Äôt understand, and we want to gain a clearer picture of what has been happening behind the scenes. Vocal support will help us to get this scheduled.

For now, filling out our form (linked in the comments) will help us show the department and University that students would like to see change on this issue. You can also join us on Discord (link in comments) where we want to continue this conversation and talk about our next steps.

Beyond that, the best thing that students can do right now: Make noise. Share this in the circles that you‚Äôre in. The funding crisis is not a new conversation, only one that we would like to begin directly informing students about and including students in. The general student body will need to be involved for change to start happening.

Some of the shit that I've seen said to and about the staff in my classes... It's been horrific personal attacks. My peers have been attacking the staff as unfair, incompetent, and cruel. I've seen the hurt and complete demoralization it causes to the staff.

I also have disagreed with some of the decisions that course staff has made and not been afraid to approach the staff with feedback about it.

You may not see them in person like you did before, but these are people. Some are professors just trying to figure out how to navigate a semester entirely online for a class in which that has never done this before. Some are fellow students that are doing this because they want to help students that are struggling in this class. All of them are trying so incredibly damn hard to pick up the shattered remains of this covid-cursed semester and make something positive of it.

These people aren't trying to hurt you. They don't have a desire to see people fail. They understand that this is a hard semester and trying to figure out how to adapt. Imagine spending all these hours and all this effort trying to make the best class you can. Imagine being faced with impossible decisions about fairness and equity. Imagine having to entirely recreate a class for a new medium in record time while a damn pandemic is upending the reset of your life. Now imagine seeing Piazza flooded with aggressive posts about how horrible of a job you are doing and, in some cases, you don't care about the students.

I think I got paid like 800 bucks a month as an 8-hour uGSI when I was at Berkeley. But I was regularly working 12-20 hour weeks. So 800 / 4 / (~12-20) ~= between 20 to 10 bucks an hour. I certainly never complained about getting paid money, but most GSIs are there for the passion. Otherwise they would be going and doing other stuff, like clubs or research or partying or focusing on their studies.\n\nYou do understand that we're the only university even pre-pandemic to have taught class sizes exceeding 1500 right? I promise you -- a ton of innovation goes into teaching Berkeley CS courses. Remember Gradescope? That was invented here to solve the scaling challenges that came with administering exams to large class sizes. You realize our autograders are custom written by past GSIs right? Ok.py is scalable on modern cloud infrastructure -- there are whole companies that haven't done that shit yet. And our AG models are currently getting adopted by *other* universities. We've made contributions to cheat detection. We've made advances in pedagogy for teaching large amounts of students. We were one of the first to even have undergraduate GSIs -- most other departments even in Berkeley only allow grad students to be GSIs. uGSIs are a thing in Berkeley CS because it HAS to be a thing -- otherwise we can't teach everyone.\n\nNow I never worked on any of this stuff, so I'm not talking myself up. But this is serious cutting edge stuff. When you're struggling with a course, you can go to an authority for help and tutoring. When we're struggling on how to handle a massive class size in a completely virtual fashion while dealing with our own personal issues at the same time -- we don't have anyone to go to.

And my BA was from a tiny liberal arts college nobody ever heard of, not a world-renown university. Also, as an immigrant, I was legally prohibited to work for a while.

Yet, I turned out fine. I probably would have gotten a better job earlier had I done better in school, but I still managed to find something to pay the bills and get me started. I didn't get to study all the stuff I wanted, but now I get to show up at Cal and take classes in exchange for stupid amounts of money. I did not get into grad school, but I watched my wife and friends go to grad school and my mental health is already bad-enough thank you very much. I worked my way eventually to a good job, etc...

This is to say ultimately that college can be shit at times. It can make you feel like a failure and like your life is going to suck forever. But the only people who care about your GPA are grad schools and maybe some companies at your first job. 3 years after you graduate, the only thing jobs will care about is ""did you graduate?"" 5 years after you graduate, literally nobody will care. (Seriously, I'm part of hiring decisions. Unless you're applying for an internship, I don't care how you did in school.)

Bottom line, doing well in college can help, but doing poorly is not the end of the world. So try to do well, but remember this is not your last shot at a good life.

I hope someone who is having a hard time can take some comfort in this.

PS: I recognize I am and was privileged in many ways. But I think the basic idea still applies to most/all people.

328,utao28,Adventurous-Ear-368,752.0,0.99,44,berkeley,"I will never let anything die! I am writing this as evidence of a realized hobby. Godspeed to anyone who reads any sentence of this.

[here is the last post for context (?)](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/u2csl0/crispest_water_on_campus/)

Armed with the curated list of the recommendations of the last post, i put on my urban hiking (aka gentrified walking) playlist and I tried the crispest fountains of youth this campus cradles.

Methodology:

I condensed the list to only include potable water sources. I didn't try blackwell, because I don't know anyone who lives there and i am not trying to trespass. Further, I excluded the recommendation of the gym fountain, because I have an intensity about me that I fear would turn me into a gym bro if I set foot in a gym. I do not wish this fate upon myself so I am guarding my feeble sanctity by not crossing the gym line. Next, I opted for a non insulated metal water bottle so that leftover chill from previous water fountains could not influence the taste of the next water fountain in the case fountains were tried consecutively.

At this point we reach a Shakespearean impasse: to spit or to swallow, that is the question. Whether ‚Äòtis nobler to only taste the water fountain or to become bloated from all the water I consume in one day trying to hit up all the fountains. Normally when faced with this impasse, I gargle. You would be surprised how little liquid it takes to gargle. However, for the sake of science I chose to swallow all of the water I tasted.

Importantly, fountains were tried on different days. Peer reviewers have pointed out this weakness in the methodology. However, a good fountain will consistently spit good crisp fluids into the crevices of a bottle even if there was no other water bottle filling action before the current fill, so the day of fill should not impact the crispness of water.

Scoring: **Anxiety (A)** was scored out of 2 (0 being please let the hot light of god shine upon me so that I may evaporate from this dreadful world and 2 being luxuriating in comfort). Anxiety noted the fearsome echo of the water bottle fill in comparison to a quite yet populated environment, general amount of people around (I don‚Äôt like having more than one person looking at me at any given moment), and if any worrisome leaks surrounded the fountain.

**Beauty (B)** was scored out of 3. Beauty includes any general aesthetics surrounding the fountain experience.

**Crispness (C)** was the main scoring factor which is only fair given the list‚Äôs method of curation. As is such, crispness was scored out of 10. Crispness includes freshness of taste and bone chilling temperatures. I wanted the water to transport me to Antarctica so vividly that I could remember if Antarctica was at the bottom or top of the globe.

14. The opulent vlsb fountain: 4 = A: 1, B: 3, C: 0

I could make tea with this tepid water.

13. 4th floor of etch to the right when exiting the main elevator: 5 = A: 2, B: 1, C: 2

The only thing i can say is that thankfully with time this water will end up in the toilet where it belongs. Disliked! Blocked!

12. Cory hall fountain near supernode: 7 = A:-1, B: 4, C: 4

Fear of eecs peoples societal superiority over a shivering social science girlie factored into anxiety. However, I confuse fear and admiration, so my type is eecs boys. The raw Chad eecs energy that made me scared of being hurt boosted the beauty ranking. These two biases balance out each other as a net neutral in the score. Controversially, I believe the water itself is actually overhyped.

11. first floor physics north and 3rd floor at the end of the hall: 7 = A: 2, B: 1, C: 4

You could go through the trouble of measuring the temperature of this water in kelvin only to find it is room temperature

10. asuc near amazon storefront: 7.1 = A: 1.8, B: 1, C: 4.3

i had to deduct from the anxiety ranking since my shoes for crews non-slip new balances sounded like spongebob squeaky boots walking to the fountain. Though, it sure was water.

9. 3rd floor of doe library by art history/classics: 7.3 = A: 2, B: 3, C: 2.3

With the amount of noise this fountain was making i expected water so cold even sigma freud would have penis envy of this spout. Yet i received nothing of the sort.

8. Gianni hall: 8 = A: 2, B: 2, C: 4

hell is colder than this water

7. kroeber hall fountain, first floor: 8 = A: 2, B: 3, C: 3

people who use sensodyne toothpaste will enjoy the water of this fountain. I don‚Äôt and did not enjoy this fountain. Though, I enjoyed the house posts.

6. Evans ground floor: 10 = A: 0, B: 0, C: 10

Lovely as always, despite being in a building so bad even the university wants to tear it down.

5. campbell hall 1st and 5th floor: 12.2 = A: 1, B: 2, C: 9.2

The fifth floor is marginally better than the first floor. The fifth floor is so fresh that I felt like an Alaskan salmon swimming upstream against all the tasks i should be doing. Unfortunately, the salmon imagery for which this water transported me made me afraid as we live on a campus full of bears. Bears fish salmon. For this reason, this is an anxiety inducing fountain

4. stanley hall / the bottle filler next to yali‚Äôs qualcam cafe: 12.8 = A: 2, B: 2, C: 8.8

I shivered.

3. Haas faculty: 13 = A: 2, B: 1, C:10

The sheer crispness of the water animorphed me into a polar bear. For this reason, I recommend this fountain for furries

2. mcCone hall, 5th floor west side: 14 = A: 2, B: 3, C: 9

right by a very beautiful patio view. I saw a berkeley squirrel (from afar) which coincidentally is the largest mammal i think i could confidently vanquish with my bare hands in a fight (now give me a sturdy stick and i could take on all the tigers at the Oakland zoo at once).

1. Morrison music hall: 15 = A: 2, B: 3, C:10

The parade people who have drank from this fountain have worn a pale yellow oval into the tiles just in front of it. You can imagine them standing in the center of the worn out tile oval filling up their water bottle; and you can imagine all the people to come doing the same, making the oval a little paler. You can do all this imaging while you know that in the present you are filling up your bottle standing in that same oval. That worn out tile was the first time that I saw like the tralfamadorians. And so I thought, maybe I should read Slaughterhouse-Five again. That or maybe i should just touch grass and let this stupid hobby of reviewing waterfountains die. So it goes.

Update of the update: they moved the elkay from the left to the right fountain in morrison hall. Therefore morrison hall water is no longer fire. This list remains in place but be cautioned that fountains may have changed.","[{'author': 'Bullshitbanana', 'body': 'I didn‚Äôt know r/Berkeley had off-season shit posting.

This list is intended for everyone who is not in EECS, as we will never be able to even dream of the riches they may attain. Bonus points if you are in a major that people ask you to explain the purpose of when you tell them what you are majoring in. So anyway, here are the top 10 free (first) date ideas I can think of as someone who tries to spend less than a crumpled $10 on any given date (except that one time...).

1. Botanical gardens: duh
2. Go hiking: Berkeley (and the bay area at large) has some great hiking trails accessible via bus, bart or mere hopping over fences. To spice things up, go to golden gate park!
3. Go to amoeba or rasputins: show each other your music taste by going through the cds and vinyls. (show off your cultural capital (social science hoes get that reference)).
4. Go to Moe‚Äôs: show each other your taste in books. This is a great way to make sure that your date is literate (you never know with these UCB students).
5. Establish a sovereign nation within the bounds of Berkeley: this unfortunately stops short of political revolution, but is a great way of quality checking your date‚Äôs political affiliation and making sure they are not a nazi. Further, on the second date you can help other non-EECS students around you find class consciousness
6. Go to Mcdonalds: ask for a cup of water and then take a seat. They probably won't kick you out if you don‚Äôt buy anything. This is a great way to benefit from the ambiance of Mcdonalds without having to shell out the money.
7. Bampfa: get into the museum for free with your student ID and show off your art knowledge (or lack thereof). For non-artistic students, I would recommend memorizing a list of shades of colors names to use during the date to make it seem like you have both a base knowledge of art and more importantly an extensive vocabulary. For example: make it a game with yourself to use the word cerulean or chartreuse when describing the art (that way you can combat the possible badness of the date with a private game of bingo).
8. A pack of cards at a picnic table: this one has versatility. Play go fish, or speed, or an actually good card game like 52 card pick up. Alternatively, you can build a house of cards together and then knock it over. You may realize the symbolism of the latter only when it is too late. such a realization of the fragility of the first few dates with someone may cause you to brainstorm a list of date ideas and aggressively regret your past actions (and texts).
9. Go up the Campanile: this is free with your berkeley id! Once you are at the top floor, you and your date can take turns pointing out the best spots on campus to cry over what could have been with a person (who is not your current date) that you never really did know. sometimes you need to get the recommendations of where to listen/self insert into to I wish you would by taylor swift

My issue with this isn't so much her attitude as it is her background: there is a pattern of Berkeley students from elitist backgrounds being honored over more qualified peers that have actually handled adversity (""[fortunately, her privilege has been a force for good](https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/05/11/rejection-turned-out-great-for-berkeleys-top-graduating-senior/)"").

1. A first-generation, formerly-incarcerated, community college transfer student who is heading to Stanford for a PhD in sociology this fall.
2. The current president of the entire UC Student Association, ASUC external vice president, and one of this year's three stanford/berkeley gardner fellows for public service.
3. A Kansas native heading to MIT for a PhD in chemical engineering
4. Another Kansas native heading to Harvard for a PhD biomedical science
